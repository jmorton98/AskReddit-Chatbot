"I remember walking to the Library about an hour after my Bio exam during my first semester of college. I took up all of the time allowed for my exam, and it was tough, but I was finally done. I just wanted to return a book and get a cup of coffee quick before heading home for the holidays. Once I got there, I was overcome with how trashed the library looked. I went to Pitt, a big public university. There had to be hundreds if not more students living full time in the library for the past week. I remember looking around and trying to take it all in, it looked like a battlefield. On the third floor, in one of the comfy chairs, I saw a kid who I am almost certain was from by bio class.  He was sleeping hard, surrounded by his laptop, a few books, pop cans, and junk food wrappers. I chose not to wake him up, because he looked really peaceful in that moment. But I can't imagine the scene that must have happened when he woke up."

'Worked in a well-known discount retailer a few years ago and was friendly with the store detectives. One day, they called me into their camera room to show me some footage they got over the weekend.  Several overhead views of a middle-aged man lingering behind various young women, looking all around, waiting for a his window, then bending down quickly to sniff their asses.  He was slick, none of them seemed to notice this guy crouched right behind them with his face just a couple inches from their butt. They got him on camera doing this like 4 or 5 times before they tracked him down and told him to leave the store.'

'I walked into the office, and there were boxes strewn everywhere and trash by the front desk. I should have walked out then, but I was a new grad desperate for a job, so I stayed. It was 100+ degrees F outside, and the AC was definitely not on because I started to sweat as soon as I walked in. I waited in the lobby area for 15 minutes, past the time of the scheduled interview. No one came to greet me, so I just waited. A UPS delivery person came and asked me to sign for a package, and wouldn\'t leave me alone when I insisted that I didn\'t work there.  After another 5 minutes or so, I heard yelling from down the hall. I couldn\'t make it out, but I figured it was better to make it known that I was there than to continue to wait. The yelling man acknowledged me briefly by yelling at me for interrupting his "important call". Finally I was able to communicate to him that I was there for the receptionist position. He tells me to wait in the lobby, so I go back. Ten minutes later, someone *finally* comes to get me. She is a short woman, severe with a RBF type of face. She asks me why I was there, and I explained that I was there for the interview. She disappears and I wait another several minutes. At this point, I\'ve been there for over half an hour. The woman eventually comes back, rudely ushers me into the conference room, and has me sit down across from her. She then spent fifteen minutes scrutinizing every part of my resume, down to the font size. She accused me of spending all of my time at work on Facebook and online shopping, and said she wouldn\'t keep me on longer than one day if she caught me doing anything on my work computer other than answering vendor inquiries and filing invoices. After another few minutes of this, she asks me if I have any questions. When I say no (I had already decided not to pursue this job further), she berates me for not being well-prepared, and that any decent candidate would have good questions. I just said...okay, and excused myself. It was the most WTF experience I had while interviewing for jobs. The crazy part is that she called me a week later to let me know that I had the job, and that I should come in to meet the owner (the yelling man from earlier). I laughed and hung up the phone. Never again.'

'>Amen is a word that came to English from Latin, which got it from Greek, which got it from Aramaic, which got it from Hebrew (technically, Aramaic may have had it anyway, before it became the standard language of the Jewish people a few centuries before the time of Christ). >It is difficult to translate this word directly, which is often a reason that words are borrowed from other languages (i.e., if there’s no direct way to translate this foreign word, just borrow it). >The specific Hebrew word amen (’amen ) appears to be derived from a related verb--’aman , which means "he confirmed, supported, or upheld." This verb is also associated with the Hebrew word for truth (’emet ),   Can\'t speak for other faith traditions but Catholics use it as a testament of faith. So when we are end our prayer often with amen, as a testament that we believe. Furthermore when we receive the Eucharist we say Amen as in we believe that this is Christ'

'I was on a square in a small village in Italy. Being the tallest person on the square I was pushed forward, someone asked me if I wanted to play. Not knowing what to do or expect I was blindfolded and given a bat. Being Dutch I understand nothing except for "stahp means stop and go means start" which are directions I could\'ve done without. So there I was in the middle of a square, surrounded by laughing locals trying to hit a moving ceramic pot. It took about 2 minutes to hit it, but it felt like it took me 15. When I hit the pot and shattered it (after hitting it with my hand 3 times before that) someone grabbed the bat and I heard children running around. Apparently, candy fell out of the pot and they were running to get it. In the pot was a sausage, some cookies and a coupon for a pizza in the only pizza place of that town. It was a very unique but interesting experience and there were a lot of really kind people, even though we could hardly understand each other. TL;DR: smashed a pot in a square while being laughed at.'

One night I was nearing the end of a dream at the point where you\'re kind of halfway between asleep and awake. I can\'t remember the details of the dream, all I know is that it was either a nightmare or just very stressful. As I was waking up I realized I was feeling something making repeated contact with my chest, and I opened my eyes to see my dog sitting over me batting his paw at me. Once I made eye contact with him he stopped, sat for a second, and then went back to his bed on the floor. I figure I must have been breathing irregularly or something, and he just thought that he needed to return the favour and get me out of my dream.'

'Yes. It\'s called the "Hygiene Hypothesis" and it postulates that the rise in autoimmune disorders such as allergies, and even asthma, is due to our living in an overly sterilized developed world. Essentially, think of your immune system as a police force. As you\'re growing, the police for gets exposed to lots of small time criminals and learns how to spot them and how to deal with them over time. Having a healthy and properly formed immune system requires exposure to some substantial degree of bacteria. When people are not exposed to that, the immune system can be malformed, becoming hyperactive and perceiving non-threatening particles as bad. The body\'s police force doesn\'t get good training, and starts stopping and frisking every piece of pollen that strays into its city. Research into the human microbiome  is a pretty big field right now, and this idea has a lot to do with it. I can get into more of the specifics, and the evidence in support of the hypothesis, as well as potential ways of combatting it if anyone is curious.'

"statistics teacher at the university, let's call him Mr. K: To be allowed to take the final exam, we had to write some report in teams of 2. I teamed up with my roommate who happened to be in the same course. We wrote lots of team-assignments together and work well as a team: we sit together in front of one laptop and one of us writes while the other one wanders around and comes up with full sentences or just words/synonymes. We switch after a while.  So Mr K. now said 1 week before we had to hand in the assignment that we have to mark which part of the assignment was done by whom. Impossible. So we could either lie and tell him that this half was done by me, and the other half by the roomie, or we could tell him that we worked in a way that we simply can not do that at all. We decided to do the latter. We thought this wouldn't be a problem at all since the report wasn't even graded or anything - it was just something you had to 'pass' to be allowed to take the exam.  He didn't buy it at all, since he somehow hated my roomie and thought he did absolutely nothing (he was working a lot and thus didn't attend the lecture much and just listened to the podcast afterwards, however presence wasn't mandatory so...). So he wrote  to both of us individually and told either of us that if we now mark the parts that either of us wrote, he would allow the person that was first to do so to take the exam.  Good thing though is that neither me nor the roomie fell for this. We straigh up went to the dean who then allowed both of us to take the goddamn test."

One of these guys starts arguing with a girl, ends up punching her. "James" feels compelled to step in and confront the guy, with another friend supposedly having his back in case things get hairy. What "James" didn\'t count on is his backup being pushed down a flight of stairs and ending up hospitalized with a cracked skull. So now "James" is in a 1 vs 5 fight, that doesn\'t go very well, ending with a concussion, fucked up knuckles, split lip, a torn piercing, no memory of the fight, and his entire paycheck in cash gone, not to mention he was not in any condition to work for several days.'

I didn't need the TV so I put up a craigslist ad looking to unload it for $100. The guy I sold it to told me to meet him at the local pizza place I was planning to go to after work to pickup a pie anyway so had no problem doing so. . Turns out the dude was the owner of the pizza joint so I ended up with $100 + 1 free pie, it was great!"

"The Bootstrap Paradox: Let's say that when you were a child, some old person taught you a song. You remembered that song all of your life. Then when you're older, you use a time machine to go back in time. In the past you encounter you as a child, and you learn him/her the song. You realise that the old person who taught you the song was your future self. But then, who originally thought of the song? Because you learned it from your old self, who as a child learned it from your own  self etc.  This is also present in one of the Legend of Zelda games. You learn an Ocarina song from an old man, go back in time and teach a young version of the old man the song. But who originally came up with the song? Link didn't, because he learned it from the old man. But the old man didn't come up with it, because he learned it from Link."

They were abusive (only violence and emotionally thankfully - I suffered nothing compared to those who are sexually abused by family or trusted adults) and I’d put up with it for years.  A few months before I’d gotten a job and a girlfriend, so by that time I was feeling pretty emboldened to the point where I got the shits and left with only the clothes on my back. I did ok for a while, then I was homeless for a while, then got myself back together. I’m very proud that even in my hardest times, I never went back, never asked them for help, and got through it.'
'Oh my goodness. A few years ago a stray cat gave birth in my backyard, so I took care of her and, when the kittens were old enough, posted them on Craigslist. Gave away 3 no issue, but then one guy. He calls me a few hours later to see how I was and how the mother kitty was doing. Slightly weird but hey, it\'s nice that he cares. Ask him how new kitty is doing. "Oh, she died". Um, what?? You\'ve had this baby kitty for like 3 hours and it\'s dead already?? Then he asks if he can have another kitten, and he could come meet me right now at my house if so. Um, no way.  He called or texted me nearly every day after that for about 2 months, trying to get me to go out with him. When I refused multiple times, he threatened to kill himself, and vaguely threatened me. I blocked his number after that.  So that\'s the story of how I got a possible kitten murdering stalker for a few months.'

"My political and moral leanings shifted for me when I attended college. There was a radical leftist group there who actively tried to stifle free speech on campus, often by very shady or amoral means, because they didn't agree with certain speakers the college had planned to host. I was someone who had always leaned heavily toward the left, but this rubbed me the wrong way. It seemed that by their standards I was far-right, because my thinking didn't align with theirs verbatim. God forbid their sacred opinions be challenged. I did actually become decidedly more conservative since then however, largely by researching the speakers I was referring to, and others. Now my political and moral opinions are pretty split, but I still think I'm basically liberal."

'For me, it makes sense to think of a "memory bank" in our brains as a library where every memory is a book kept somewhere in the location. To remember it, your brain finds it and recreates it, but every time you lose some of the finer details around it. It may be that some auditory information is lost or the visuals get a bit blurry or sometimes the majority of the audiovisual and sensory information about the memories can be lost. What I mean is that you\'ll probably remember having fun at camp a few months ago, but you might not remember the exact number of people who were around, what they wore, who was saying what, yadda yadda. Only the things you care to remember or consider important enough will eventually push through into long term memories. Sometimes we have books that get checked out of the library more often. These books get worn out the most and eventually some pages will go missing until the book is reduced to merely a faded cover, maybe just an image in an ever growing catalogue of memories/books. The interesting thing in this analogy is that the brain is like a library which automatically dumps or recycles books which you never bother to check out. It slowly makes you forget about smaller details to make sure that there are enough pages to keep making new books. What I\'m saying is that the brain\'s library is like an automated system with indexing, content addressable lookup and a lot of features like this.  I personally like to visualise the "memory as a library" example like this because it also gives me an interesting point to think about: \'Every good library comes with a librarian, doesn\'t it? If so, then who is the brain\'s librarian?\' I like to believe that the animus is basically the keeper of this library. Over aeons of births and rebirths and experiences, it keeps a thorough record of basically everything it sees and experiences. As the library gets burned down and recreated again, everything that used to be in it is shifted into archives, summarised and kept hidden, only to be known to the librarian. It\'s an amusing idea for me to consider although I don\'t know if I would ever claim it to have any scientific or rational merit.'

"I was blowing bubbles," the second man jokes, the bartender laughs at the joke and goes about his business.  The third man then goes into the bathroom, the first man has not come out yet. He walks in to the bathroom and is in there even longer than the second man was. Finally after a long time he comes out.  The bartender asks the third man, "why were you in there so long?" The third man repeats what the second man said, "I was blowing bubbles," at this point the bartender just rolls his eyes and keeps on working.  A few minutes later the first man who has been in there all this time comes out, and sits at the bar.

'I was visiting some friends in Southern Ontario in what\'s typically seen as a college town. We were wandering around these railroad tracks with a sparsely distributed array of aparment buildings, houses, little shopping plazas ... but all in all it was pretty barren. It was about 4 in the afternoon on a Wednesday, and as we\'re walking down the street, we pass a yellow block of a building w/ a small wooden sign next to a huge metal door to the right of us with the words "The Wow Store" written in sharpie. It took us a few paces past the place to finally decide to turn around and check it out - it was all too mysterious. We step in and were not disappointed. Picture a hoarder\'s house but with the absolute coolest vintage goods, and then what looks like a garage door actually leading to a factory converted into a warehouse with MORE stuff - some dating back to the late 1800s... The placement of all of these things were somehow deliberately precarious. A few minutes after tinkering with toys and drooling over the EnTiRe Warehouse wall in the back full of books - this tiny, tiny approx. 85 year old man comes sneaking around to greet us and we spent more than two hours there speaking of his life story, his childhood battle with typhus, his brother\'s death, conscription in the army, family history, near bankruptcy for stubbornly keeping the store alive, solid life advice, and cute little anecdotes... we walked out with two bar stools for my friend\'s barren apartment, and hearts aglow for a lifetime.'

"When I was seventeen, I was in a T shirt printing shop that a mate used to own. Whilst there, a guy came in and wanted a picture of an orphan printed on a T Shirt. As my mate started work on it, I began chatting with the guy and his wife. I discovered that he ran a local charity that delivered food, aid, and medical supplies to the orphanages, hospitals and villages in Romania. This was back in the early 90's and the whole situation was being highlighted in the news, so I was aware of the problems. One week later I was in the truck driving across Europe heading to Iasi in Romania. I spent a good few months there, working in the various places. I saw lots of horrific things, but its still the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life. Working with the kids was fantastic, they literally had nothing, but gave so much love. Apart from the clothes, food, and supplies we provided, the kids just appreciated the time and affection the whole team gave them.  The great thing is that it was a huge life lesson for me too. Any difficult times I've encountered in my life as I've got older, have definitely been made easier, as I can always recall that experience and remember the situation those kids and people were in. Its easy for me to see that things aren't always as bad as they seem, and there's always people a lot worse off.  I definitely think I gained and learned so much from those kids, hopefully as much as the little I could give to each of them."

This is a patient I had only had a very brief, civil, interaction with on the phone, so I don’t think it was personal, I think they were trying to shake down the hospital for money and didn’t care if they ruined my life in the process.  Lucky for me I had literally never been in the building where they were inpatient. I also was in business meetings in an off site location the day the assault supposedly took place. Lastly, I’m 4’11”, at the time weighed about 92 lbs, and I’m a vegetarian who LITERALLY wouldn’t hurt a fly. The idea of me assaulting a large male patient who was not incapacitated is honestly comical.   What bothered me most is there was no repercussions for the patient. When presented with the incontrovertible evidence that they were lying, they admitted to being “mistaken,” as if you can just accidentally make a claim like that. No, they didn’t ruin my life, but they tried, and experienced no consequences for it.'

So end of the year comes up and I take all of my stuff and move out, and he said he would be moving out the next day. Well, come August, I had transferred schools, so I wasn’t attending anymore and one of my friends from the cross country team we were on sent me a text asking if I knew my friend wasn’t enrolled in classes there anymore. I said no, and she then begins to tell me this: My friend had lived in the dorms the entire summer without a single person knowing he was there, and when people started moving in, he had to move out and he started living with his high school girlfriend that was behind the college. So people would see him an think he was still attending the school. Nope, never enrolled back in classes, and still amazed he was able to live in the dorm rooms the entire summer without a single person knowing he was there.'

Another fun one is "raining cats and dogs" because animals used to sleep in the thatch roofs of houses, so during big storms the animals would come falling out of the ceiling into the house.'

"Have you garnered any lasting benefit from evils you undertook? Breaking the law, violating other people, stealing, verbal abuse? I have cured my existential anxiety from undertaking evil acts of stealing. I was a prolific shoplifter for about five years. It was the main source of my income. I feel that I have freed myself from cultural pressures from my evil actions. I feel that I have affirmed my right to exist by taking from others.  I realized that life is what you make it, however you make it. I'm now a positive nihilist turned hedonist. I haven't stolen in seven months. I'm slowly reworking certain cultural pressures back into my mind, because my life as a thief became untenable. I've been sober all this time too. I feel that my evil actions have gained me a better acceptance of life. I'm now attending college and have goals to be a self-actualized lawful citizen, because I found that good, honest living does feel good. I'm basically doing it because it feels better than being homeless, not because of any moral imperative. If homeless shelters didn't suck, I'd still be out there. There's an old Christian sect known as antinomianism. It says that we're released from law by grace. Certain sects even took it further, claiming that committing evils like necrophilia brought them closer to God. I certainly feel closer to God than I used to. This is because I wielded my personal agenda with impunity for many years. I have experienced impunity. That's God right there. I don't mean this to be religious discussion (though I'm fine if it turns out that way) but I just wanted to include some historical basis for evil enlightenment. My question is, has evil improved your life? Whether your evil or someone else's."

And having parents who don’t get deported because of their DACA children has the same scenario.  That being said, I think it would be difficult to deport people who have grown up here, speak only English, and are seemingly functioning in society.  On the other hand, there is no legal mechanism for them to pay taxes.  On the other hand, taxation is theft.  So I don’t know what to think, but I’m leaning towards letting them stay, but creating a mechanism for which they are as liable as everyone else to pay taxes.'

There’s also the financial factor. I think Trump, either directly or by consequence, has financial ties to organized crime in Russia, or the Putin establishment itself. I don’t see how it’s even possible to do business with millionaires in Russia for 30 years without crossing some legal boundaries. So, no treason charges, no charges related to campaign collusion, but I think Mueller will find some financial crimes, or if all else fails, obstruction charges. I don’t think Republicans would get behind impeachment for obstruction charges alone. The party is beyond that at this point, as they’ve proven with their continued efforts to shut this investigation down.'

'Your two questions have the same answer:  It depends on several factors. 1.  The first language of the student.  Similarities between the first language and the target language (English) can aid in comprehension.  Differences may be a source of trouble.  \n2.  Skill sets of students.  Some students may lack skills needed to learn a new language, such as decoding.  Therefore, some students need to be explicitly taught these skills in order to be successful, while others do not.  \n3.  Cultural background.  Language function differs greatly in all languages, and does not always correspond to what is literally said.  For example, I could either be apologizing, or asking for information, or asking you to repeat yourself, or asking you to move out of my way by uttering the phrase "I\'m sorry", depending on the context.  However, in other cultures/languages, this phrase, once translated, may not make sense in all of those contexts. Hope that helps!'

"Every surface - well, every ferromagnetic surface - was covered.  Completely covered.  It was those alphabet magnets, the smallest ones they make. The detective, surveying the bloodied and devastated living room asked the question in an offhand way.  More as a joke than a real question but - and this is the important part - he *asked*. That invited **it**, or what was left of it, at any rate.  It followed the detective.  It learned the detective.  It left little signs - a door that took just a little more pull than usual, spoons somehow sticking together - but, as it got more and more agitated, it became more... assertive.  Waking up one morning, the detective found his fridge bare, faded vacation souvenirs and kids' artwork (not that he'd seen them for years, damn that harpy) scattered on the floor. He didn't notice, didn't see the scratches in the white paint - 'c me'. It got worse.  Keys vanishing unnaturally deep under the radiator, knives all but launched from their hanging strips, revolving doors going into a nightmare spin as he entered.  Still, he failed to see. Eventually, he went to the hardware store, intent on fixing what were surely failures of his home. He never left."

What I was told was that they had 1 group of students feed, interact, and show kindness towards the crows, while the 2nd group would come and shake the cages, y’all aggressively towards the birds, and would not be feeding them.    \n     \nAfter the crows were freed, they often hovered around the campus and would recognize the different people from group number 2. This would lead to them swooping down aggressively near the person or people from group 2.   \n    \nI believe they would often bring gifts, like pebbles, sea glass, tiny miscellaneous items they deemed as gifts for the students from group 1 who they recognized as being friendly and kind to them.'

So, I left, and we agreed she'd give me back $800 since I was only there a couple days. While I was still getting my stuff in order, I get a text from her, threatening to throw all my things out on the street if I don't come get them ASAP. This was not even 24 hours after we agreed that I leave. I rushed over, got my check and things, and then left. A week later, I check my bank account and found that she had cancelled the check after I deposited it. Fortunately I had access to free legal help and got my money back since cancelling checks without consent is completely illegal. We never spoke again.

'Although I had my own experiences in my two deployments during my own time, I wanted to share the experience of my grandpa from his memoirs, who was a US Marine in Korea during the early 50s. The below story is the reason I started this thread. *Mountains on the eastern coast of Korea, early 1950\'s.* *"It was a normal set up with two people to a hole with the machine gun out on a point. I was the first-gunner then, and took the first watch, and my assistant gunner, whose first name I can’t recall, but I think his last name was Perry (or that was possibly his first name), was sleeping.* *All of a sudden, I saw this big, black object coming up on the hill. It seemed too big for a man, but nevertheless, it was lumbering up the hill towards us. I woke my assistant gunner, and he also saw it. Then it seemed to come toward us, then stop, then come, then stop. So I threw a grenade at it, then it stopped. Still too big for a man, but whatever it was, it was coming up the hill toward our position. It still seemed to move after the grenade exploded, but not too much forward that we could tell at night with a semi-moon. Then “it” stopped. So we both stayed awake and alert.* *By the way, the reason you throw a grenade, rather than shoot a rifle or fire a machine gun, is because the muzzle blast or flash gives away your position, especially at night. But by throwing a grenade, they (the enemy) can only see where it explodes, not where it came from. Also of note, because the machine gun can deliver so much firepower in a short time, it is usually the weapon the attacking force wants to take out first. For this reason, it was not unusual when we would set up, usually just before dark so you could establish fields of fire, to move the machine guns to a secondary location (usually the better of the two positions) after darkness has set in.* *Now back to the attacking enemy coming up the hill. Come daylight, and after a lost night of sleep, the object took form.  It was a big bush, or what you may call a tumbleweed, and it was caught in the barbed wire. The only thing we could figure was that the wind has caused it to lumber up the hill, and about the time I threw the grenade, it had gotten caught in the barbed wire and “settled in for the night”. As it turned out, we lost some sleep, but we had successfully repulsed the attacking tumbleweed."* **TL;DR: Something was lumbering up the hill towards their position during the night, he hit it with a grenade, and by morning, they found out they successfully stopped the dangerous incursion of a tumbleweed.**'

'I got sleep paralysis one time, which is where you wake up and are conscious but can\'t physically move your body at all.  There\'s a neurotransmitter in the brain that suppresses physical movement during most of sleep.  Normally it "clears out", so to speak, instantly when you wake up, so you can move as soon as you wake.

"I did Acid once a few years ago. My friend and I had an apartment together and dropped at noon since the high will usually last around 8-12 hours. When it first hit us both, we just did a lot of laughing, I though my friend tweaked out because he was laughing and freaking out so much, granted he took more than I did. We watched a movie and I remember that the people's heads in the movie looked distorted and sometimes peanut shaped and oblong at times. I would then look over to my friend and his head looked normal. I remember staring at the stucco ceiling and it would move like a river. I probably spent a fair amount of time just watching the ceiling. My friend insisted that we stay hydrated during our trip because he heard that it could prolong our high. This meant multiple trips to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom a few times and It looked like my stream of pee was a rainbow. I was pissing rainbows! I would say that my hallucinations were mild. I didn't imagine any living beings like you often hear about or see in movies or TV. We came down around 11pm and a friend of ours drove us to Bojangles and we ate biscuits.

I'd probably ask them to skip covering Led Zeppelin's catalog, though, because nobody could do Zep songs better than Robert Plant did them to begin with.

I'm a web developer by trade and really hope that somewhere out there, there is a nice, peaceful, steady company, that i actually enjoy working for/believe in their product(s) and people. Or i want to start my OWN business because then at least i can choose my clients. But also having to deal with the downsides of freelancing usually keeps me targeted on finding a decent job. But do i just have to either start my own business, or cope with the fact that most jobs suck? Or is it common to genuinely like your job and mine and my father's overall careers are just two cases of otherwise many people with jobs they like?"

'As an 1980s kid, obviously my golden age is all Game Boy, NES and SNES. But in the late 1990s, Playstation hit and I went into my silver age, maybe my favorite age of gaming. I remember, as a kid, the perception was that video games was for boys, and furthermore being passionate about video games was for nerds. But something was slowly changing around the mid-to-late 1990s. I remember getting some kind of magazine-disc for my original Playstation, with a few sample levels of Wipeout XL and a hidden music video for Ginuwine\'s "Pony." "Wait a second... this is a song I\'ve heard, on a radio station! And I\'ve seen Prodigy on MTV, they\'re doing music for a video game, too?!" Shortly after, The Cardigans released a music video for "My Favorite Game" off their album Gran Turismo. Gran Turismo was and is my idea of the hippest video game. Real cars, a game based on European Formula One, actual mainstream music for the soundtrack (this is before Grand Theft Auto, mind you). It just felt like around that time that society and culture was catching up, and video games were coming into their own. Also around that time was Goldeneye 64 which was the afterschool activity of choice among my highschool peers, even the ones on the varsity sports teams got into it. Maybe this is all the rose-colored glasses of a nostalgic thirtysomething, but what was your gaming golden and silver ages?'

As a result, no amount of numbing agents were going to get the job done painlessly.  In fact, they didn't work at all.  Two assistants  held my shoulders and one held my head back and from the moment the dentist broke them to the moment he wrenched them free, I was in a horrified shock, knowing the only way out was through.  It was the only time in my life I've ever involuntarily yelled because of pain."

She was super passive aggressive and anal about a ton of stuff, so to avoid adding something else to the list of dumb things we fought over I just stopped singing in the shower.'

I listened to this fascinating youtube show yesterday where these two really smart guys, Bret and Eric Weinstein, (no relation to Harvey Weinstein) talked about the Pareto Principle, among other interesting topics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmXq97do-tQ The Pareto Principle is what's commonly known as the 80/20 rule. Basically, 20% of causes create 80% of effects. This maps onto the universe at both a cellular and a stellar level, indicating that it's some sort of natural law that we don't understand very well. Something Eric brings up, is that if you restructure academic courses properly, you can get 80% of the benefit for 20% of the work, but this makes it very tough to get 100% of the benefit. Basically, you could never get a PhD, (or you would have to restudy almost everything) but you could get a master's degree in about 20% of the time if the order you learned things in was different. As automation starts taking over more jobs, this seems like the sort of optimization that we should make for people that want to pursue higher learning but don't want to get a PhD."

'Cop here: Other than pre-planned events or riots; A few years ago an officer was shot and pinned down behind his patrol car. He got over the radio, gave the emergency code, and said "Send me everybody". And that\'s exactly what dispatch did. Every unit who wasn\'t tied up on something extremely important was put on the call and responded. For context, my department is fairly large with a few thousand officers (though not all on duty at the same time). Everyone including officers who don\'t respond to calls like detectives and Vice units ran over there. This was also near an adjoining agency, so pretty much that whole department was there as well. There was a line of patrol cars that stretched over a mile long at the scene. All-in-all, it was ultimately decided that it was a bit of overkill.  They\'ve since changed the way emergency calls like that are dispatched to avoid that situation in the future.'

"Personally I found it fascinating to watch the kids hit each new developmental step. Every couple of weeks at first, then every few months, you see them change from being entirely helpless, to becoming more and more independent, able to physically do things they couldnt before, and mentally levelling up to greater awareness of themselves and the world - before they can speak you look in their eyes and realise there's an intelligence and awareness looking back at you that wasnt there a few days before. If its a skill you've helped them develop there's an even greater sense of pride. Most animals go from young and helpless to essentially fully functional pretty quickly, there arent a lot of stages to it, but watching human children grow up you get much more awareness of how complex we are and how much there is for even the most basic and average person to learn."

'FOR BACKGROUND: The answer may seem obvious, but I\'ve been going through a roller-coaster of emotions regarding my most recent job offer. I start next week in a fast-paced, competitive job with very high earning potential with a fairly large company that\'s growing rapidly. I\'ve been super excited about the opportunity because it\'s everything I\'ve been looking for. It wasn\'t until yesterday when my father said something jokingly about "shouldn\'t I be studying" when I was watching tv (something he used to do when I was in grade school, cause I procrastinated a lot and hated studying). For some reason, this comment made me start to question how much pressure we put on ourselves our whole life. We have to go to school and college to get an education for the first 20 or so years of our lives, and this is immediately followed by (hopefully) entering the workforce. So far, I\'ve said very little that isn\'t common knowledge, but I\'ve found when I write these thoughts out, I get to the root of my question/main concern(s). I guess a side question is, why do we get so excited/anxious to get in the workforce right after spending so long in the tedious-ness (for some of us) of school? This ties into my main question, because it would seem like we would be burnt out already, but obviously some jobs give us so much more pleasure that what we had to learn in a classroom. I\'m personally glad those days are behind me, but what is it that makes WORK more exciting than SCHOOLWORK? Is it just the money and pursuit of financial independence? And if school didn\'t fulfill you, where do the "right" job\'s fulfilling qualities come from that make you want to come to your job and work day after day for years (in terms of a career)? There\'s been a lot racing through my mind the past couple days, so if anything above doesn\'t make sense, I\'m more than willing to clarify. Furthermore, I hope this is the right sub to ask all these questions.'

By lunchtime on day 3, we realised we’d gone way off track in the dark. We walked as far as we could, but one guy in the group had fallen ill, so we stopped early evening. Day 4 before lunch we stumbled across a road and just sat there and waited for someone to drive past. As it was in the middle of the Australian outback, this could have been a very long wait. Luckily, after about 5 hours of waiting, someone drove past, and relayed a message to the camp supervisor to come get us.  Got back to camp late evening on day 4... sick as hell and relieved as fuck.

Upon entering the residence there was a teen girl who had been having anal sex with her boyfriend, the father of the girl walked in on them. The motion of the boyfriend pulling out and her clenching her butt, it caused her insides to come outside..... all I know is she was rushed to ER and her booty insides were put back inside!!!??!!'

"I used to have a lot of the Starships from Star Trek: The Next Generation. They were a good size and had all the sounds on them like for engaging warp drive, firing phasers/torpedoes.  I loved playing with them when I was a kid, but I was quite reckless with them. I'd love to still have them but in pristine condition as they had stands you could put them on too. They'd probably be pretty valuable by now. The ones I used to have were: * NCC 1701-D Enterprise\n* NCC 2000 Excelsior\n* Klingon Bird of Prey\n* Klingon Vor'cha Battlecruiser\n* Romulan Warbird It makes me so sad that all of these are long gone from my life as I grew into a lot more of a trekkie than I was back when I actually had these toys."

'My brother died just 13 days ago. He was just of 14. It was the beautiful morning of 3rd October of 2017. I was reading newspaper and enjoying the tea. Mom and dad were busy in their tasks. Suddenly my brother came to me and said- BROTHER, I WILL BE LEARNING ANDROID APP DEVELOPMENT AND SOMEDAY I WILL BE A VERY GOOD DEVELOPER. I looked at him, smiled and said YOU CAN’T BE ANYTHING. YOU CAN JUST MAKE ME FOOL.  I said this because it was normal that if he comes to me in morning with his new ideas, there are 99% chances that he will demand some money for fun. Well, I gave him $10 and said to him that go and eat something and forget about everything.(because I am here for you and you don’t need to do anything as I love you.) So, the day flew away. In evening, he came to me and returned my money. I was shocked because it was never happened till now. Well, I asked him the reason (because till that day, he did not returned any single penny) and he said that he needs my laptop and it is the deposit. I saw him with feared smile. Feared I was because he even didn’t knew that how to turn on the laptop(even Basics you can say) and what if he will crash my system by pressing the keys. I was smiling also because I was thinking that he has been mad because it might be that his friends told him and they even don’t know that how this world operates itself. Well, After some sweet fights…I agreed and I gave him my laptop but with secondary account. As well as, I installed wireless internet connectivity, so that he can use the Internet(by searching some odd keywords) and he will learn at least something. I also told him some basics like how to use Internet, Google Chrome, MS Word, Notepad etc and rest i left all over him and believe me, it was amazing to see him while trying to search the keywords which even don’t exist.  After 7 days, he became master in surfing internet and typing something. Also, he learnt that there is a service named YouTube which relates to videos for everything. So he started watching videos related android development and all. As well as, also he started reading the articles on internet related to android development. It took him 18 days for understanding the everything  which was needed for developing an application. Even, I was amazed to see him that he was too fast in learning the programming. After doing all this, he demanded a brand new laptop. I didn’t gave him new one because till now I was not sure that he going to create something. So I gave him mine with full access.  After taking my laptop, he starting waking up for 18-20 hours in a day and started writing the codes. I remember that he never wanted to sleep those days even after my requests. He wrote 1000 of codes each day and when he stuck somewhere, he starts exploring the forums for his problem. Also, he was learning the PhotoShop for UI from YouTube.  Till that stage, I didn’t know that what he was creating actually. And finally, output was InPhone Music Player. He was very happy and he announced in street that he is mini Sundar Pichai.  He launched beta version of his app on playstore as well as on some more websites on 8-9 December and started sorting out the bugs. After he unpublished his app from Playstore(Later he got that you can roll out the full version from beta stage) and prepared full launch. It was 14th January, 2018. He was very excited because today it was his birthday as well as, he was planning to launch the full version of his app. He took my bicycle and went to market for taking something for mom but didn’t returned. After searching, we found that he was in a nearby hospital because he meet an accident. We reached there and shifted him to a new and better hospital but he couldn’t make it and left us. While, it has been 13 days without him…I started learning android since today for pursuing my brother‘s dream (Her dream was watching his app till 1L download). I will make his application as best as I can and I will make his dream come true. I have uploaded his music player on Google Play store. You can also checkout https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mybsolutions.musicplayer A Small Request- Please don’t rate him negative at Play Store even you don’t like the app. Just mail at the support email that what is the bug exactly and uninstall the app. I will definitely fix that bug and will let you know. If any YouTuber is reading this article, please review his app on your YouTube channel. I will be very thankful to you.'

They\'re both women, and from their armchair psychologist perspective, they think that I\'m extra concerned about having a traditional relationship, with a strong male dynamic, because I grew up around an untraditional relationship, with no male dynamic.

They can easily cross that distance in 8 seconds, but then it's just a matter of thinking quick enough to use their teammates help in the short amount of time. It has to be 8 seconds because this forces them to be urgent, which regular layup warmups don't allow for as much."

Morals are individual, and based on the belief that something is right or wrong. Ethics on the other hand is more a standard agreed upon by a society. There is no absolute right or wrong, and you can take more nuanced positions. For instance, you can try to make the best decision based on the best outcome for the majority of the people. This makes it possible to make decisions without assigning an arbitrary value to it.'

He was smart). I come back for training, turns out the actual job is cold-calling people to convince them to give us money.  It was billed as collecting for charities, but the whole thing felt sketch as hell.  Like, if we were calling on behalf of some sort of police gig we were supposed to imply as hard as possible that we were police but weren't actually allowed to say it.

"I used to have a group of friends in school, one of which lived in a huge house. It was perfect for sleep-overs, and more importantly, for hide and seek. \n&nbsp; We're playing one night, and I'm hiding in an en-suite shower with a frosted glass door. I was doing pretty well. Someone even came into the room and then left. I heard them discussing that they should check the shower, but since they were a few rooms away, I decided to bail and find somewhere to hide in the room itself. Unfortunately it didn't go to plan, and there was nowhere to hide. Since they'd come through the room to get to the bathroom, I knew I was going to be found. I just stood next to the bed and accepted my fate. \n&nbsp; One of my friends walked into the room, looking around. He even looked in my direction, but for some reason he didn't notice me. I have no idea how this happened, and he was looking around the room for a good 10 seconds before looking again in my direction (and to be clear, I'm just standing there, in plain view), so I just screamed as loud as I could and rush towards him. \n&nbsp; I've never seen a more intense look of horror on anyone's face in my life. He screamed, and I genuinely thought he was going to pass out. I can only imagine that for him, it was like I'd appeared from nowhere. \n&nbsp; We didn't play hide and seek again."

'My girlfriend in the Army (now wife) was having a number of medical problems, the most serious of which were seizures of gradually increasing severity and duration.  There were a number of spectacular fuckups by the Army docs in regards to their failure to properly identify the problem ("oh its just a stress disorder"), and properly treat it (gave her an anti-seizure medication she was allergic to, nearly killing her); but perhaps the most stupid was their modification to her profile, simply because of how idiotic it was. They decided that her symptoms were too severe for her to participate in regular army physical training (PT), and ordered her to do pool PT instead.  If you can figure out why putting someone prone to seizures in a pool is a bad idea, congratulations, you are smarter than an Army doctor.'

'I work in a popular electronics and home appliance store (thoroughly enjoy it and the people I work with, would recommend/10) $10k AUD 85” Sony Bravia LED/LCD with $1400 amp, $6k worth of Dali speakers + extended warranties on most (told them not to bother on the sub, the tech is pretty straightforward a very small amount can go wrong and usually appears early on) plus some white goods, vacuums, new iMac and some software, was around the $23k mark in the end, the dude was a champ, easy to chat too, spent maybe an hour and a half with him all up because we just kept talking about stuff not even related to the sale. Ended up shedding a few hundred off some of the stuff for him but otherwise he didn’t ask for my “best price” or anything else and was really friendly and respected my answers to his questions and talked out with me how he’d heard XYZ about the speakers and I gave him my side/rebuttal and he was happy to take my advice as to why they might not be as good as say KEF speakers but are much better value for money for the type/frequency of use he was getting them for.

"Resolution & pixel pitch. A typical monitor likely has more pixels than a 1080HD TV....and certainly more than a 780 or standard def TV.   Also consider than a monitor's pixels are smaller / closer together.   If a 50 inch TV and a 20 inch monitor have the same number of pixels, the monitor has a finer pixel pitch....they are closer together so the details appear sharper. This does tend to balance out, because you view a monitor from close up, and a TV from further away.  But if you look at the TV up close, it doesn't compare well to the monitor."

'I was pregnant with my first baby, and it was technically a “high risk pregnancy” because I have type 1 Diabetes. This mostly meant that I had to be REALLY careful with my blood sugar levels, and they had to monitor the pregnancy VERY closely.  This meant I had to miss a lot of work for appointments and “non-stress tests” (they strap a monitor to your belly and make sure the baby is moving and its heart beat is normal) at the hospital.  During one of the earlier non-stress tests, they detected that I was having contractions. It’s normal to have minor “Braxton-Hix” contractions during pregnancy, but apparently what I was having were too strong, too early. I called into the office to say I’d be later than expected, because they’d have to give me meds stop the contractions. The receptionist took my message and wished me well. She called back a few minutes later and said, “(Boss) said don’t come in today. Your work can wait. She wants you to rest.” I did.  The next day I’m back at work, and my boss (who was one of the company owners) came over to my desk. She asked how I was doing, what the doctors had said, etc. All was fine, and I conveyed as much. She sat down and quietly said, “Look, I want to make sure you and your baby get through this safely. That’s really important to me. I want you to take all the time you need to do this right and not stress yourself. Don’t worry about your leave balance. If you need more time off than you have, I will help make it happen.”  I was really touched. She genuinely cared more about me and my baby than her bottom line. Her husband, the CEO and co-owner, also came by my desk to make sure that I knew they wanted me to make my health a priority. In my time there, I saw the owners and VPs of that company go above and beyond for their employees. One of their employees, whom they had never met in person because he worked at a location in another state, died suddenly from something like a brain aneurism. They had one of senior management fly out to that work location not only to help the other employees as they adjusted, but also to see what the company could do to help the deceased’s family. He had life insurance, but they also helped with his funeral and final medical expenses.  I’m not going to pretend that it was a perfect workplace or that they were perfect bosses, but I never once felt unvalued there.'

'I worked at a cinema and the location was 5 years old so we had two big arches with a lot of balloons near the entrances to celebrate. Some of them would randomly pop but there where a lot of balloons. One day I heard one pop, then one more- and more and more, very rapidly. I walked over and saw a little boy with a knife, stabbing the balloons with such anger it was as if they had personally killed his family and made him watch. The mother was close by, and only decided to speak when she saw that I was going to say something. All she said was "Johny, give me that knife". Nothing about not stabbing balloons, no shock about him having a knife in the first place, no apologies to me for the balloons. They left the theatre before I could say something.'

'"Sweet-talking the deal". This is the gentle art of price negotiation. Some people mistakenly believe bad mouthing the merchandise works. It rarely works well. You are better off getting the seller to want to sell it to you, as opposed to someone else.  There is a lot involved in doing so and not the least of it is learning to read the seller\'s body language.  From the selling standpoint you want the buyer to come away from the deal feeling very good about their purchase. They are paying not just for a physical item, they are also paying for a positive feeling and memories.   These are what makes you or breaks you when buying and selling antiques and collectibles.   My wife and I met an elderly antique dealer at an auction over 30 yrs ago and struck up a conversation with him. We kept running into him at auctions and flea markets. We became good friends and we learned a lot from him. Not the least of which was everything has a story within it, waiting to be shared.'

'I didn\'t attend a single gender school, but in high school they were a bit sexist, in the sense that all girls must take dance and all boys must take physical education.  I argued with the school until they let me into the boy\'s gym class because I hated dancing and the teacher was like a drill sergeant... he would stand on the girls\' backs and make them do exercises that they couldn\'t even do. He used to make us do 10-minute planks and if our stomachs touched the ground, he\'d come around and "sweep the floor," as in, he\'d get a broom and "sweep" underneath you so that if your stomach was touching the floor, you\'re essentially getting hit with a broom.  And I told the dean about that and I said that\'s abuse. The only reason I was allowed to switch was because I showed them that I had bruises from that class and they finally let me switch over. Gym was much better, and I functioned perfectly fine being surrounded by boys.  I don\'t understand why anyone would ever think that separating people by gender is ever a good idea.'

'Myth: Dogs are special and different because they’ve lived with humans for thousands of years. Reality: Until the VERY recent historical past, dogs were useful outdoor creatures eating what they could scrounge up or be tossed out of convenience.  The cow throat.  The pig spine.  A still-born goat.  Bugs. Rodents  Cow shit.  Grass. Whatever.  It wasn’t brown pebbles of soybean oil, chicken feathers, and wheat flour.  They were fitter, more useful, no allergies, and perfectly fertile. Myth: OMG I HAVE TO RUN TO THE STORE SO MY FUR BABY DOESN’T GO HUNGRY.  We’re out of dog fooood!  He hasn’t eaten ALL DAY!!! Reality:  They are fine.  They are better than fine.  Their senses and activity levels come alive with hunger and when burning their own body fat stores.  In fact, it’s the best time to train and maintain their attention with food and toy rewards.  Far less picky about food too, if that’s ever been a problem. Myth: Dogs can’t eat bones are cartilage anymore. Reality:  When it’s raw, it’s perfectly fine.  They know what they can manage.  They have teeth.  Hard bones are recreational, soft bones like wings are just chewed up. Myth: Dogs aren’t prepared to deal with modern germy meat. Reality:  They’d be eating road kill and be fine doing it.   Myth: Parasites! Reality:  Not a myth, actually.  You should worm your dog occasionally, but mostly because it probably trots around where OTHER DOGS and wild carnivores and scavengers take a shit.  Not because of parasites in the human food supply. Myth: Bowel obstructions. Reality: No.  Toys obstruct them more than real food. Myth: Cracked Teeth!  Dogs are special and dainty! Reality:  They aren’t suicidal.  They know how to fucking eat and chew with caution. Reality: Breath is awesome Reality: They always void their own anal glands Reality: ZERO TARTAR Reality: No “dog smell” Reality: Dogs aren’t fur babies.  Let them be the plebians they want to be.'

I told them that I had exams, and if I was staying until 7, I needed the next night off. They said that I had to work, so I said that I was officially calling off for tomorrow. They told me i needed a doctor’s excuse to call off, and if I didn’t, I’d be terminated. \nI then said that either I don’t show up tomorrow and lose my job, or I walk out the door right now and lose my job, right?

'In 2005 I went to RIT in their new media publishing program. It was a combination of web design, graphic design and printing etc. In the summer of 2007 I got an internship with the power company. It had nothing to do with my major, but I needed something for the summer. A family friend worked for said power company and suggested I apply. Sure enough I got a spot. After the fall quarter (yes, quarter, RIT was/is fucked up) I got suspended for non-academic reasons. To keep it succinct I will say I got suspended for doing the same shit that every other college kid does, I just got caught.  The power company allowed many of the interns to work nights and weekends, or during school breaks. I came back and said my school plans had "changed" and they gave me 40 hours a week.  Ten years later I am still with the utility. I am a journeyman lineman, I\'ve been doing that for over five years.

Now, this made everyone go scilent because of the look on his girlfriend\'s (I\'ll call her M) face. \nHe (I\'ll call him R) had been in one relationship before, and it was relatively short. M had been through a few relationships the latest of which had been abusive. \nShe was instantly hurt, asking him why he\'d say that. He nervously chuckled and said that she\'d said it once before and they laughed at it, to which she responded by saying that they were in private at the time. \nThey kept going on about it, and at some point she started to try and make jokes that were like "Hey, Arch, can you take R home? JK!" \nThey finally made up, but only after I pulled him aside and explained that there are some things you simply don\'t joke about in public, even if you joke about them in private, and that it\'s not so much that he made the joke, but more so that he made it around friends that M really holds dear and that she doesn\'t want them to judge her or him or their relationship. \nMy girlfriend pulled M aside and basically told her that R didn\'t mean it, and was just trying to joke along. \nHe\'s a very sheltered kid, and is not all that great about social interactions, if you couldn\'t tell. So they finally made up, and were able to communicate their emotions effectively. We were all really proud of that. It takes some massive balls to put yourself out there like that, and they did it.

He's got a learning disability, and a bit of a rough background, and he's hard headed. But in a poor family of 7, there's not a lot of support to go around. My folks did their best but they made it pretty clear that as soon as he graduates high school he'd better get a job. He didn't graduate, predictably, and always thought he was slick enough to hustle without a job. That worked for a couple of years, but after one too many warnings and broken promises my folks kicked him out. He just wasn't prepared for it. He honestly thought they'd never do it. And he found out pretty quickly that he'd burned all his bridges and never noticed. So he had to sleep rough for a year while working shitty jobs to try to get enough to eat. We all patched it up eventually. He learned a lot. He's still hard headed, but he knows how to maintain relationships now."

This 'parent' was also on their phone with the brightness up. I was livid. Assholes who bring children to late night movies should be banned.  Simply because you think there will only be a few other people in the theatre does not give you the right to bring a small crying child. Find a babysitter or accept the responsibility. Young crying children do not belong in the theatre! If you must bring them, most theatres offer sensory friendly showings off age appropiate films."

'Omg this was very difficult. It took years. At first I used the clear nail polish “stop the bite.” I used it for a couple of months and it helped me to not bite bc it tastes like bleach (or what I imagine bleach would taste like). But it was so horrifying when I’d eat food and accidentally get the taste in my mouth. It would ruin my appetite. So then I switched to always having my nails done with gel nails bc I couldn’t bite the gel off. But that got expensive after a few months. So then I started taking anti-anxiety meds, and that helped a lot. But that stuff is dangerous. So then I tried to just always cut them really short so that there were like no nails to bite on. And that kinda helped, but they did not look good. Eventually, as I started my career after college, I realized how embarrassing it was to have bit nails, and I certainly realized how unprofessional it looks to bite nails in front of people. So that really did the trick for me and I don’t bite anymore. And now, if I am tempted, I keep a glass nail file with me and I just trim them so that I’m not tempted. And also, I chew gum a lot. Oh and lastly, after a couple of months of not biting them, they got much stronger and prettier, so it helped as a deterrent bc it was like a reward for not biting.'

And after completing that pass, move back into right lane. Repeat as needed.  I really don\'t understand why people can\'t get this.

"Back in college we had a kid in our class who was 17, fresh out of high school, from a small town up in the boonies. Because he could turn on a computer and use google, his whole family thought he was god's gift to computers, which went to his head, so he through he was destined to be an amazing programmer. In reality he was stupid, lazy, arrogant, and in general not nice to be around. He quickly got frozen out of study groups, and started venting about us on facebook, forgetting he'd added us all as friends at the start of the semester. We rebutted a lot of what he said, until his mother joins in and starts defending him. I wish I'd screencapped it. His mother, a woman I assume in her late 30s early 40s, typed like a 12 year old with ADHD. Random capitalization, punctuation wherever she felt like adding or ignoring it. Just a free flowing stream of consciousness that made no sense. But the gist of it was he was a perfect angel and a genius and were were all jealous idiots for not supporting him. We all laughed about it and left him alone. We decided if that was where he'd come from, he had no chance to begin with. (He ended up failing 3 out of 6 classes first semester. Last I heard it took him 4 years to complete a 2 year program, and he had to beg not to be kicked out."

After breaking out some of the worst dance moves known to man, I projectile vomited onto my cousin's shoes and the entire place saw it. Still the butt of the jokes around the holidays."

I realized I did it with yawns, too. I\'m normally pretty quiet and monotone. But if I sneeze or yawn, it\'s like I\'m trying out for the opera. I go out of my way to add intonations and flourishes.  And I did it subconsciously because my family was so dramatic with their sneezing and yawning, too. After that, I realized how everyone else made an effort to conceal their sneezes and yawns to a normal decibel level.  I\'ve destroyed so many people\'s peace and quiet with this warpath of destruction. I\'m so sorry. I apologize to anyone and everyone who has encountered it.'

That's when I noticed the girl going under and trying to come back up.  So I jumped in and swam past the guy towards the girl.  When she comes up a little I grab her from behind and tell her to calm down.   Kind of yelled it at her and she just stopped.  So I was able to get closer to the where my cousin and he pulled her out.  Then I go back to the guy, he was easier and he was managing to stay above water.  I just got behind him and just pushed him little by little towards my cousin.  \nOnce they were out, we just told them to be careful and continued on to the shore.

"Not me, but a friend of mine encountered some crazy shit while travelling in Taiwan. This was around Taichung. There were four of them, Her with two other girls and one guy. Hopped in a Taxi and gave driver the destination. He goes the right way for a while, then abruptly pulls off into a side road. Still driving along, my friend asks him in Mandarin where the hell he's going, since they've been to this place before and they know wherever they're going now is not what they asked for. Driver says nothing, gets on the celly and speaks to someone on the other end in Taiwanese. No one in the car understood this language, the mystery was in how the driver figured this out since they were all Asian and could have easily passed for natives visiting home for the holidays. The car pulls into an open field, surrounded by trees in every direction with only a single house in the middle of it. He parks right outside, and it appears people were emerging from the building. Several of them. Driver pauses for a brief second, starts the car up again, and commences driving along. A few minutes later, the group find themselves on the side of the main road as the cabbie drives off. What the three girls in the back of the car did not know at the time was that upon stopping outside that house, their fourth member sitting up front pulled out his knife and held it right above his knee. Making sure it was in plain view of the driver. Once the cabbie saw this, he started the car up again. No doubt realizing the dangerous situation he inadvertently found himself in. They never figured out what the driver planned on doing, but anything even close to kidnapping couldn't have been good. Cabbie was reported to the authorities, but they left for the states before finding out anything further."

One finally falls and bashes his face, starts screaming. Mommy comforts him enough, then goes back to ignoring him while he runs around. You know you\'ve done goofed when servers are trying to correct your kids.  It finally got to the point that both children are standing on chairs, stomping up and down while screaming. This is the point at which I blurted out, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" This went on for about 20 minutes before the parents finally moseyed their asses out the door.  \nI have 2 kids and I have left restaurants for far, far less. One of my kids has autism and can be disruptive. I\'m a little more understanding if there\'s only one adult (maybe they need to pay their bill before they can GTFO), but when there\'s 2 adults, someone stays behind to get doggy bags and the bill while the other loads up the kids.

'My father used to drive a cab. One night a drunk guy got in the front seat (it was the 70s so whatever), and noticed that my father was (and still is) Chinese. He said something to the magnitude of “hey you’re Chinese aren’t you? Do you know any of that kung fu”. My father did not (and still doesn’t) and told the drunk man that he did not. The drunk man didn’t believe him  and demanded that my father “show me some of that kung fu”. When my father said (again) that he really didn’t know kung fu, he grabbed his hands while he was driving and tried to fight him. He was able to stop the car safely and used some non-Kung fu to kick the guy out of his cab.'

I know it was stupid to take the bait (not to mention about such a silly topic) but I was so sick and tired of his narcissistic, know-it-all, better/more-than-everybody personality that I just had to stand up and say NO, not this time.  I’d been silently dealing with his cocky, me-me-me attention-demanding bullshit all vacation and I finally just snapped.  Even he was shocked into silence for once.  It was less of an argument and more of a nipping in the bud.  (He was pink-shouldered and slept like a baby compared to my lobster-red trunk, feverish restless trance, and all-night chills.)

"When I was like 3 or 4, my grandmother passed away and soon after all of my extended family flew in town to have the funeral. A week after the funeral, some relatives were still in town, including my uncle and his family. \nMy grandmother wanted us to sell the house after she passed, so my family did exactly that. It was hectic cause we were trying to pack everything up meanwhile everyone still had to go to work and school. On one of the days that we had to pack up the house, my parents both had work, my older cousins had school, and my uncles and aunts had jobs/other stuff. However, my uncle (grandma's oldest son) was available to watch me for a couple hours so he did. According to him, I asked him to go to the bathroom while he was watching tv. The closest bathroom was in my grandparent's old room so I went there. When I came back, I asked my uncle who the nice lady was on the bed. He kinda played along with it because he might've thought it was an imaginary friend or something. He asked me questions about her to entertain me. I described her as dark haired, kinda white, and wearing a blue night gown. When I said that, my uncle freaked out because my grandmother always wore a light blue night gown to sleep. \nAfter that, my uncle and I left the house and waited outside for my parents to come back home."

When break time came, I was kinda just standing outside on my own eating when I got a tap on my shoulder. Spun around to this wide eyed guy who\'s first words out of his mouth were "Will you be my friend?" Bit random but I said sure. 13 years later, we\'re still best friends lol. According to him, he didn\'t know anyone either and saw that I was on my own so he decided to be friends with me.

The conversation gets to a logical conclusion and we turn to face opposite sides of the bed, the classic butt touch.  \nI know what you're thinking: she farted, it felt weird vibrating on my butt. No, gentle reader, vibrations and farts are no strangers to this blossoming love. This was a sobering revelation greater than when we first learned that women poop on January 5th, 2007. My beautiful, baked pastry of a lover scratched between her legs, raised it to her nose, and inhaled.

Instead of the teacher coming to get us, she sent a kid from another class. The other two left. Me? I was too afraid of getting in trouble from the fact it wasn\'t the teacher herself that I stayed. When they got back, I had the absolute face screamed off me. Took me outside, while in tears, and took a photo of me releasing the balloon and put it up beside the photo of the whole class. All because I was told not to leave "under any circumstance" and I obeyed that because it was a kid I didn\'t know that told me to leave. I, to this day, think I did nothing wrong there.'

"Shortly after an internal redecoration of most of our office building, about half of the people got a new electrically height-adjustable desk. We (local IT dept) found out that the connector connecting the control buttons of those desks to their control boxes, were standard RJ45 (network cable) plugs. So naturally, we decided to patch each desk (both control panel and control box) to available network wall outlets, and in doing so, reroute each control panel to the control box of a random desk through our server room (directly from wall outlet to wall outlet, so no network switches involved). The result was impressively awesome: as soon as the first person tried to adjust his desk, some random other desk would shift in heigt, resulting in the owner of that desk trying to readjust it back, in turn inadvertently adjusting some other poor bastard's desk, and so on and so forth. End result: a chain reaction of total mayhem, us rolling on the floor laughing, and at the end statistically about 50% of the desks in their lowest position and 50% in their highest position."

'In 1994, I was driving through Ohio and my car kept overheating.  It was a Sunday and there wasn\'t a phone book at the pay phone, but I managed to get a AAA operator to give me the numbers of several truck rental outlets.  I got through on the third one I tried. So I told the guy I needed to rent a truck and he told me he was closed and was just in the office doing some bookkeeping.  I persisted and explained that I\'d like him to go to another rental place and pick up a car dolly (he didn\'t have one) and bring them both to me at this truck stop.  He laughed and said they didn\'t deliver. I allowed as how I understood that it wasn\'t his normal business practice, but I had a nice $50 bill that was his if he could rescue me.  He told me he\'d be there in about 30 minutes.  I saw the truck approach the parking lot and ran over to flag him to my car.  When he pulled up and opened the door to get out, I handed him the fifty.  He said, "I like the way you do business", and we got to work on hooking my car up. Then we went to his office to do the paperwork on the rental and put my credit card through his embosser thingy and I was on my way home to Missouri.'

They are also excited for the benefits it might have to Schizophrenia and other conditions of that sort.  The drug was developed based on Ketamine (the anesthetic) which is used as a street drug. Doctors knew it was good for depression when they realized suicide victims would rebound in their outlook and mood instantly after being given Ketamine (usually after a surgery) So researchers figured out a way to make a medication for depression which works on the same neurotransmitter (a whole new kind for depression) but without the hallucinogenic side-effects typically found with Ketamine.  The drug is being looked at as the biggest jump in mental health treatment since the SSRI. It's seriously exciting and as someone who dealt with depression for over a decade, I have to wonder if this is the miracle that I've been waiting for."

This guy had been hit by a car when he was 9-10, and the resulting trauma left him with the mindset of a prepubescent boy in grown mans body.  The cooks at this restaurant were a bunch of drunks who loved to fuck with this guy. It was pretty harmless stuff usually, but one day one of the cooks made a slit in a piece of roast beef and started fingering it, telling the handicapped guy it felt just like a pussy. He then gave the handicapped guy the piece of roast beef so he could feel himself. Everyone has a laugh and got back to work thinking nothing else about the beef. About two hours later I had to get something from the mud room (room with water heater and cleaning equipment). I open the door to find the handicapped guy bare assed, just hammering away at the roast beef with his donger. I tell the manger, he laughs his huge fat ass off, and he proceeds to tell everyone else. Everyone working that night thought it was hysterical, but they didn't walk in and see this shit the way I did. 2/10 would not recommend."

CEO is cool, culture is cool, the work is cool, etc.etc. Or is there always something about the company, the culture, or the way things get done, etc.etc that just doesn't work for you in a visceral way? When my father speaks of his career overall, he never got to a point of liking his job, and same with me. I'm a web developer by trade and really hope that somewhere out there, there is a nice, peaceful, steady company, that i actually enjoy working for/believe in their product(s) and people. Or i want to start my OWN business because then at least i can choose my clients. But also having to deal with the downsides of freelancing usually keeps me targeted on finding a decent job. But do i just have to either start my own business, or cope with the fact that most jobs suck? Or is it common to genuinely like your job and mine and my father's overall careers are just two cases of otherwise many people with jobs they like?"

"Middle aged person had a hip replacement and was rehabbing, everything seemed to be going smoothly, they were making steady progress.

'For me it was a guy that I had the same class with in the last year of high school. He was pretty big and very strong. He would go to the gym every single day. He was also very agressive. For example he pushed one of my friends against the wall when he said something like "that\'s my ex there over there" and my friend would reply with "who? the red one?" and quite some people came to get in between them. I remember how big my friend\'s eyes were. With our first sport class of our year we were with 2 classes at the same time at the field. And one of the guys from other class was kind of arrogant and he was kind of trying to be that "popular" guy. I wasn\'t really paying attention to what exactly happened but our guy gave him a big push and he kind of flied away. It seemed like it was for no good reason at all. Everytime I would want to mention his name I\'d always look around first to see if he was near. I don\'t want him to be behind me and over hear me and then grab me after school and rip my head off my body.'

'Honestly, the best one is when one let me off without a speeding ticket so not very great.  3 way tied for worst is \n1) my sister (18) had like 5 guys over and they were out back on our lanai hanging out. They were out there for so long my sister ended up falling asleep and when she did, the guys took every Mac book computer we owned and left. Over 5000usd worth of computers. We have the cops their names and addresses. They went to each house and asked “do you have the laptops?” The kids said “nope” and the cops were on their way. Did nothing after that. I suppose it’s that easy to steal. 2) my other sister (16) has a boyfriend that doesn’t have a car. She would let him drive if they have to drive anywhere and she would sit passenger seat. One time when they came to my house my father saw that he was driving and told him “You do not drive my car. Ever”. Well a few weeks later he asks my sister to use the car to go to a job interview and my sister is too nice and agrees. Well my mom gets a call from my sister at 8 pm and she is balling. Apparently there has been a car crash with injuries. Come to find out at the accident scene\n- she wasn’t in the car\n- the kid and his friend were in the car\n- his friend has his own car (why the fuck weren’t they using his car\n- they were spreading on wet roads in a NEIGHBORHOOD \n- they spun out and hit a woman putting her kid in her car and took her FUCKING LEG OFF\n- they never got out of the car to help as the woman lay there screaming in agony\n- the car was found 100-150 yards away with its front axle snapped (they tried to drive away and found out the car is inoperable)\n- my sisters boyfriend blames it on the other kid when the cop asks who was driving\n- my sisters boyfriend doesnt even have a drivers license\nThe cop writes him a ticket for CARELESS driving which comes with a maximum 6 month suspended license (which he doesn’t even fucking have) and a 500 dollar fine. My family got sued by her even though my sister wasn’t in the car and my father had already told him to not drive the car. The settlement was for $1.25M. My mom asked the cop (on the day of the court hearing for the kid to see what the penalty for the careless driving ticket) “do you think that justice was served” and he replies “yes I do”.  3) We were driving through Bradenton Florida on the way to my beach house in my buddies truck. My buddy is a pro athlete (baseball).  We have marijuana in the car as well as a grinder and it kinda smells. We get pulled over because my buddies truck has expired tags and the cop smells the weed. He orders us out and searches the car and finds it. We tell him that if anyone in our car (five people) gets hit with that, it will severely fuck up our careers and to please have mercy. No mercy hear. He says “all take it or one takes it”, so I take it. At the time in the masters program for Aerospace Engineering at UCF and I tell him that I’m going to need a security clearance and this is going to fuck that up. He said “I don’t care” and proceeds to give me a written arrest. 2 years later, I land my dream job at Lockheed Martin for 77k/year and never get to start because I have an arrest. I’m a recruiter making 35k a year now.  Cops don’t protect and serve, they do the bidding of the government to lock people up and dish out fines. Ruining people’s lives because they want to feel all powerful.'

'If they havent told us about aliens yet, its up to us to not ignore the abundance of evidence. Like seriously, Comment I saved: While possibly not aliens, definitely UFOs: ASTRONAUTS "I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth." — Colonel Gordon Cooper, Mercury & Gemini Astronaut "I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real. It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now." — Captain Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut "...I\'ve been asked [about UFOs] and I\'ve said publicly I thought they [UFOs] were somebody else, some other civilization." — Astronaut Eugene Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander "I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. [...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared." — Captain Donald Slayton, Mercury Astronaut "Statistically it\'s a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they\'re so advanced they\'re even doing interstellar travel. I believe it\'s possible they even came here." — Dr. Storey Musgrave, NASA Astronaut "For nearly 50 years, the secrecy apparatus within the United States Government has kept from the public UFO and alien contact information." "We have contact with alien cultures." — Astronaut Dr. Brian O\'Leary "In my official status, I cannot comment on ET contact. However, personally, I can assure you, we are not alone!" — Charles J. Camarda (Ph.D.), NASA Astronaut NASA, CIA, ARMY, AIR FORCE ETC "Unknown objects are operating under intelligent control... It is imperative that we learn where UFOs come from and what their purpose is..." (1) "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe that unknown flying objects are nonsense." (2) — Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, first Director of the CIA, 1947-1950 "We had a job to do, wether right or wrong, to keep the public from getting excited." (2) — Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific consultant for Air Force Project Blue Book "Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence." — Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII "We must insist upon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination." — J. Edgar Hoover, first Director of the FBI "We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity... anything you can imagine we already know how to do." — Ben Rich, former Head of the Lockheed Skunk Works "This \'flying saucer\' situation is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena. Something is really flying around. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious." — General Nathan Twining, US Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 1955-1958 "Unidentified Flying Objects are entering our atmosphere at very high speeds and obviously under intelligent control. We must solve this riddle without delay." — Rear Admiral Delmar Fahrney, USNR "The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets". — General Douglas MacArthur ROCKET SCIENTISTS & PHYSICISTS "It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. There is no doubt in my mind that these objects are interplanetary craft of some sort. I and my colleagues are confident that they do not originate in our solar system." — Dr. Hermann Oberth, the "father of modern rocketry" "I am completely convinced that UFOs have an out-of-world basis." — Dr. Walther Riedel, chief designer and research director at the German rocket center in Peenemunde "The least improbable explanation is that these things are artificial and controlled... My opinion for some time has been that they have an extraterrestrial origin." — Dr. Maurice Biot, leading aerodynamicists and mathematical physicist "The possibility of reduced-time interstellar travel either by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations at present or ourselves in the future, is not fundamentally constrained by physical principles." — Dr. Harold Puthoff, Director, Institute for advanced studies at Austin, Author of fundamentals of Quantum Electronics SOVIET / U.S. PRESIDENTS "The phenomenon of UFOs is real. I know that there are scientific organisations which study the problem. It must be treated seriously." — Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev "I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth." — President Harry S. Truman "...I strongly recomment that there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on this subject." — President Gerald Ford "I don\'t laugh at people any more when they say they\'ve seen UFOs. It was the darndest thing I\'ve ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was." — President Jimmy Carter "I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, "Nope." And I said to him: "Let\'s follow it!" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it." "I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside of this world." — President Ronald Reagan Anyone is welcome to provide evidence that a quote is legitimately out of context, and I will remove it. All credit goes to /u/Alx__ for compiling these. Sources for these quotes can be found at http://spaceflare.net. Many of them are on video, in context. For example, this one. It is recognized that quotes are not proof. However: There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.

"My company has a pretty complicated attendance policy. Everyone gets Paid Leave (different amounts depending on how long you've been working for the company), but there is no distinction between sick days and vacation days. There used to be a problem with people using up their vacation days, so they wouldn't alert the company to a planned vacation, then just call in sick to use a sick day. The company decided to combine them to prevent this problem. That's not the complicated part. We ran into another problem where pretty often people would just call out if they didn't feel like showing up. Since sick days and vacation days were the same thing, people started to feel like there was no problem with just not coming to work so long as you had paid leave time to use. This started to really effect productivity, because it's pretty difficult to plan when people call out at the last minute all the time. To combat this, the company started a complicated attendance policy based around points. If you tell the office more than 24 hours ahead of time that you need off, there are no repercussions (sort of). If it's less than 24 hours before, you get 1 point. If you call out AFTER the work shift has already started, you get 2 points. If you are going to be less than 30 minutes late, but call before the work shift starts, you get 1/2 point. If you are going to be less than 30 minutes late, but call AFTER the work shift starts, you get 1 point. If you don't show up, and don't call in, you get 3 points. Each point disappears 1 year after you got it (so if I had no points, and called out today, I would have 1 point that would go away on 2/8/19). If, at any time, you accumulate 4 points, you are ineligible for the annual raise until you drop below 4 points. If you accumulate 6 points, you are brought in for a performance review, and, depending on the circumstances, may have further punishments. If you accumulate 8 points, it's grounds for immediate termination. There is also a 3-year rolling point count. If you accumulate more than 16 points (I think, maybe it's 12) in 3 years, that's also grounds for termination, even if you didn't have 8 within a single year. Finally, even if you call more than 24 hours before the work shit starts every time, there is a cap on the amount of time you can take off in a year (paid or unpaid) at 6 weeks. If you need to take off more than that, you can talk to management, and they are usually pretty understanding (we have a number of foreign-born employees who travel to their home country for a couple of months, and they can usually get management to agree for that), but you will probably be taken off the health insurance plan during your extended leave."

'I have fibromyalgia, which means chronic nerve pain, and I\'ve had it since I was a young teenager. I went to my general practitioner, and she was the one who diagnosed me. When I complained about not knowing how to function or have an active or normal life with the constant pain and exhaustion, she put me on hydrocodone. I was on opiates for years, despite the fact that it\'s well known in the medical community that opiates just don\'t help with fibromyalgia, and it\'s a bad idea to try to put someone on opiates for constant chronic pain.  Because I took them daily for years, I build up both a dependance and a tolerance, and eventually after putting me on higher and higher doses, she put me on a fentanyl patch - super heavy duty pain medicine that just doesn\'t do much for me (except get me high and manic so I don\'t notice the pain) and I\'m pretty solidly hooked.  The DEA was cracking down on regulations in my state and she was nervous, I guess, because a lot of places were getting shut down for being pill mills. Instead of taking responsibility for putting a kid on this heavily addictive medicine, not putting any effort into treating fibro instead of the pain, and tapering me off, she dropped me as a patient entirely and refused to give me any medicine - including the anticonvulsants and beta blockers. I almost died from the withdrawal. I don\'t think 100% of doctors are like that one, but the whole situation sure fucked over my ability to trust doctors, and I\'m much more hesitant to go to a doctor about any problem if I can tough it out or try to figure it out on my own. Even after anything it took a while and someone with outside perspective to realize "hey it\'s pretty fucked up for a doctor to put a 13/14 year old on opiates for almost 5 years." (That\'s not even getting into the life-threatening allergic reaction I had to some antibiotics that were given to me "just in case this rash is from an infected spider bite".)'

I sound so privelleged I know. But as a white straight male, the freedoms and way of life have never been really under threat. But now, with mass immigration and high muslim birth rates, I realize it'll never be the same - they are going to try and get their own religious based laws implemented. The things we take for granted, could be taken away. And it terrifies me. Women simply wearing what they want could be a thing of the past, by the end of this century."

We had to get security, surveillance and the DCI involved. After DCI took the drugs away a woman came to the front desk looking for a 'baggie of medicine' that she left in the bathroom. I couldn't believe it. I went back to my boss's office and told her that there was a lady at the front looking for her 'medicine' that she left in the bathroom. My boss had me contact DCI while she tried to stall the woman out front. After I made the call, I stepped out to the front just in time to see DCI running across the casino floor and into the atrium. The woman sees the commotion out of the corner of her eye and takes off running toward them to get to the front door. She was able to make it out of the front door and to the valet area before DCI tackled her to the ground and handcuffed her."

"My great grandma passed away in the '80s, and shortly after she passed,  my dad (who was living with her, caring for her, and taking care of her arrangements at the time) cleaned out her deep freeze in her basement. On the day of her funeral, my dad and his brothers were at her house with some other family members, and my dad's brother Al decides he's hungry. He goes down to the basement, and comes back with a gallon-size plastic baggie of frozen chocolate chip cookies that he had found in the deep freeze. These cookies were my grandma's specialty and this was the last batch she had ever made. To this day my dad swears up and down that he had completely emptied the deep freeze and has no idea where the cookies came from, and I have to admit a giant bag of cookies would be hard to miss. They microwaved them one by one so that the whole house smelled like her cookies one last time.  This was before I was born but it's a family legend now. I don't 100% believe in spooks, but hearing stories like this makes me wonder. There's still so much humans don't know, so I don't think ethereal shenanigans should be counted out."

Her mother was a prison guard and super protective. If I got caught I could have been casterated. I looked behind me and saw a f*cking raccoon watching us. It scurried off and she lost the mood, so we left. A month later we found a new area because people started to develop that area. We were doing the same thing, me travelling up and her down, and again, another rustle. I look up and I see another raccoon in a tree watching us. Again I almost shat myself because this place was much closer to her house. Ever since then I have a vendetta against raccoons.'

'**If you have a formula in Excel that you need to copy to every row in a set of data...** Enter the formula in the first cell. Hit Ctrl+Enter to enter the formula but stay in the same cell. Find the fill handle - the little black square in the bottom-right corner of the cell frame. Double-click it. It\'ll automatically fill the formula down the length of your data, until it encounters a break in the data. **If you have a large set of data you need to filter, calculate, etc, try this...** Make sure your data has a header row at the top; select any cell in the range. On the Home tab of the ribbon, go to "Format as Table". Select a format that looks good to you. Excel will automatically try to find the full data set; you can change it if you wish. Check the option "My table has headers", and hit OK. It\'ll create a data table for you. This isn\'t just formatting; it affects how Excel handles that set of data. If you need to put a formula into it, it\'ll automatically fill the formula down into all the cells of the table. When you add new data to the end, the table will expand automatically. If you need to use the data in a chart or pivottable, you can just tell it the name of the table, and it\'ll automatically include all cells in the table. Autofilters are automatically turned on. You can add a totals row to the bottom. Makes handling a large amount of data MUCH easier.'

"Guess, I will kick this one off. When I was still in Middle School I would ride home on my bicycle. This particular bicycle lane had a bus lane right next to it, with no railing or anything next to it. As a kid I absolutely hated having to tie my shoelaces. So, I wore these sick kicks with velcro instead of shoelaces. When I finally got new shoes (with laces), I sucked at tying them. They'd get loose every 5 minutes or so. Anyway, school's out. I jump on my bike and start going home. Everything is going all right, until I noticed that I couldn't move the pedals anymore. I quickly look down and see that my shoelaces have become completely stuck in the pedals and gears next to them.  I somehow end up losing my balance and fall to the side... right into the bus lane. I look up (still a little dazed) and notice that my head and torso are right in the path of a bus heading for me. I tried to get away, but my legs were underneath my bicycle with my laces still attached to the pedals. The bus was speeding a little and was already pretty close. Somehow, the busdriver doesn't notice me and just keeps driving. I panick and try to get away, but can't move the bike or take of my shoes. Kind of accepting my fate, I just lay there, until some guy rushes over and pulls me of the road. If he had been any slower and if the busdriver still somehow didn't notice me laying there, I would probably be dead now. Ended up thanking my saviour and tossing my new shoes. TLDR; Almost got beheaded by a bus, because I suck at tying my shoelaces (still do)"

HE\'S YELLING AT ME WANTING TO KNOW!" \nHe said, calmly: "Well, Glenda, we are trying our best, but we are up against a pretty tall order of service tickets, and more keep coming in demanding same day service that you are writing up, so I can\'t say for sure if we\'re going to make it on time or not. I will call him and update as soon as I know".  \nShe complained. The owner demanded we fire him. Owner never liked the guy because of the way he looked. Ratty haired metal guy. But he wore the uniform as required. He followed dress code. He kicked ass at his job. Boss hated him, found a reason to get rid of him. Made me do it. I refused. So my boss did it and I got written up.  \nThe name of that employee that got him fired? I said it in the quote, dummies. It\'s Glenda. That is her real name.  \nThat employee\'s name that got fired? Tom Brady. Just kidding about that last part.  Anyway the whole thing fucking sucked. I gave that bitch every amount of shit I could until I left that job. The end.'

My girlfriend at the time\'s answer was "this story doesn\'t represent me, so therefore it doesn\'t represent all women. Q. E. D.  The teacher said she was wrong.'

"Roast Chicken and Vegetables: Step one: Magic Sauce * Buy some fresh Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. * Cut it up fine and fill up a mason jar about 1/3 of the way with the herbs. * Fill the jar with olive oil. (This will preserve the herbs). * This mix lasts about 6 months. Step Two: Prep Vegetables * Cut your vegetables and place them in the pan. (I use a glass thing with a lid, but a bread pan will work if you have tinfoil to cover it). * You want enough vegetables so that there is space for air to circulate. * I use carrots, brocolli, a quarter onion, and brussel sprouts. Pick whatever you want to roast. Red potatoes work well. * Add 1-2 teaspoons of magic sauce and stir into the vegetables. Step Three: Add Chicken * You want a very specific cut of chicken for this recipe: Chicken Breast, Skin on, Bone on. You want this because a) it's cheap and b) it works better for roasting. * Peel up the top layer of skin (but don't detach it). * Rub some of the magic sauce under the skin. * Rub some of the magic sauce on top of the skin. Step Four: Cook * Place the roasting pan in the oven at 430F. Cook for 30 minutes. * After 30 minutes, lower the temperature to 370F and put a lid on the pan (use tinfoil if you don't have a lid). Cook for 30 minutes. * After 30 minutes, take the off, turn off the oven, and let the dish sit for a few minutes (so some of the moisture can evaporate). And there you go. Once you have the magic sauce in the jar you can prep the meal in about 10 minutes (7 if you chop fast), and it cooks in one dish (less cleaning!)."

She broke up with me over it.  Despite it being a move that would have potentially been destructive to my career, it turns out she 100% expected me to tell the company to go shove it, and just sit with her and hold her hand and be there for her in the wake of the earthquake, even if it meant we both got in trouble with the company. Again, unharmed, we were even one of the lucky ones who had no damage to our stuff or living space.  She just -- felt every single person in California, including me, who went to work, was insane and unacceptable.  We split up. Prior to that we had a very very deep connection, or at least I thought we did.  We would talk until 5 am and get up at 7 am to go to work, exhausted but in love (not every night lol)."

Been years since I felt suicidal and I am generally happy 90% of the time now. No more manic breakdowns, no more self-hate.

I don\'t consider myself agressive in the daily live, but I was in that dream. I was in some sort of fort or castle in no particular era/age. People got guns and swords and spears. Everything that could be considered a weapon. I fought everyone, I was angry the entire dream and hurted lots of people. Magically, nobody was really wounded. Example: somebody hit me, but not very hard and I just grabbed his skull and smashed it against the wall. Time after time. At the end of the dream a woman in a blue dress turned around (I saw here lots of times, but always just the back) and I screamed, for no apparent reason, "You betrayed me!! You betrayed me!!". They had to drag me away from here and she smiled very evil. I really don\'t know how and why she betrayed me, but then I woke up, sweaty. It was frightening sometimes, but also hilarious. The most fun I had in a dream ever, not that I would do it in real life, but very much fun.'

So in his class, you could take any test as many times as you wanted until you got whatever grade you wanted to get. He didn’t give students an A, but he gave every student the opportunity to get an A. He also took a personal interest in each student’s life. He offered personal help to students after school. He offered personally taught review sessions the week of each test where he would go over exactly what we needed to know for the test and then just answer as many questions as people had. But most importantly, he was a great person to go to if you had any problems or concerns at all, even if they had absolutely nothing to do with math or school (very important for hormonal 13 year olds to have an adult figure who is responsible and kind and they trust with the most important and private things of their messed up middle school lives).

Person 2 had more authority and it was decided, 67 F it is. Well Person 1 began wearing a full snow suit in their cubicle in a petty attempt to prove their point to the manager that they were cold. Person 1 got fired, and ironically had to step out of the office into the sub zero temperature weather outside.  The real kicker here is that after they were let go, the temperature went up to 70 in the offices.  Maybe you had to be there, but it was pretty hilarious.'

So say, someone like dumps you or cuts you out of their life for a while and then they come back to be polite and say hi, or whatever and because you have dissassociated, you have no clue what is going on, and your response to their check in is inappropriate and not based in reality at all.   Then when the person who dissassociated realized how inappropriately they responded to the shit ball that dumped them for a piece of pond scum, they are stuck dealing with the shame and embarrassment."

He was there for my entire shift, standing behind the registers and watching. Every time a family came through with a thanksgiving meal, full cart, he'd step up, and pay. Just every time. Cash in hand, whole total, wouldn't accept any argument, this huge smile on his face. That man spend close to eight thousand dollars that one day, and didn't see a dime of it for his own gain."

I think it really galvanized a lot of left wing protest movements too.

'I know the traditional logic of something as ‘classic’ is being 25 years or older but culturally this seems like much more of a subjective question. If we go with the 25-year standard that would mean something like Duran Duran’s Wedding Album or Radiohead’s Pablo Honey is classic rock. While someone like my mother has a hard time thinking of 80s rock as classic, but to be fair I think that may more of a result of her not being able to realize how long ago her teenage years actually were instead of not knowing what ‘classic’ means.'

To answer in advance some questions that I\'ve gotten on Reddit before, no, she didn\'t know that he had left the videos on her computer.

He looked confused (because, in hindsight, they weren't talking about me), and said sure.      \n    \nProblem was, I didn't have Super Nintendo.. I had regular NES... my nerved got the best of me, so I said the wrong thing.  In classic 8 year old fashion, I was too embarrassed to correct my mistake.       Anyway, we worked it out, and he came over and we played Nintendo. It ended fine, even though I felt like an idiot when he asked where the Super Nintendo was.       It's a little thing, and in the years that followed my self-confidence and social skills improved.

That sub is dedicated to the discussion of not just the podcast, but the entire case as it continues to drag through the legal system.  It’s by far the best source of police and attorney files, transcripts, legal notes, source documents, etc, and a source-linked timeline of the case (spanning decades) that seems like something the FBI would produce.

'Impossible. Source: grew up on a farm.  A REAL farm,  where every dollar I ate be it an ear off corn held back from market or an ear of corn bought as corn bread at the store was purchased by the sweat of my father\'s(and later my own and my siblings brows)  Land is about 5-6k an acre in many farming areas.  To have enough land to do farming as a true life sustainable business, not a hobby, you need between 2 and 4000 acres.   To farm that land you need to purchase between 200k and 1m in equipment depending on the cash crops, your desired quality and your ability to fix the cheaper equipment that WILL break.  The expensive stuff breaks too but might get a season or two in before you have any major repairs \nWhich brings us to tools, you\'ll need probably 2 to 3 K in tools minimum. Better to plan on 10 as you\'ll want some more specialty items that are rare but must have when needed.   You\'ll then want a place to store them,  looking at probably 30 to 40 to put up a decent un insulated shed big enough to store your equipment and work on them.  \nWhich brings us to free time,  do you have any?  If so plan to give it up 13 months of the year.   If you\'re not planting, you\'re caretaking. If you\'re not caretaking you\'re harvesting. If you\'re not harvesting you\'re repairing. If you\'re not repairing you\'re not farming.  Tldr If you didn\'t grow up on a farm,  have a childless uncle who farmed, or already have enough money to retire but are looking for the dumbest way to blow that nest egg you\'ll not do it as a business,  if you are independently wealthy you can do a hobby farm which is a hole in the ground you throw money into for fun.  Edit also on equipment prices that 1m is still a decade old used equipment, brand new a single tractor will be 1m before you add the leather wrapped place you bang your head against while fixing it. Also as example of how much real farming sucks.  I and every farm kid I know spent literally months of our lives (true time not like it\'s been 3 months but like if you don\'t count sleep,  shitting, eating,  crying and planning an escape time it still equals months) picking up rocks by the 5 gallon bucket full.  (Why you ask? Because rocks are literally pushed out of the soil by the freeze thaw cycle and a rock any bigger than a 50 cent piece has the potential to irreparably harm a $75 to $150 part) I got paid at 6 years old .25 for every 5 gallon bucket of rocks I picked out of fields. And I was the luckiest farm kid around because I got paid at all.   We were one of the "wealthiest" farm families around.  Dating in HS I literally had parents tell their daughters to date me because I was a land baron esque heir lol'

'Wow the story of my daily commute is relevant on the internet. I live in New Jersey and work in NYC, so I take the NJ Transit train from New Brunswick to NY Penn Station which is usually a 65 minute trip unless I am lucky enough to catch an express that might be only 45 minutes. But that doesn\'t include getting from my house to the train station (15-20 min), waiting for the train (anywhere from 0 minutes when I run to catch the train at the last second to 20 minutes if I miss the train I was running for, with an average of maybe 5 minutes waiting) or from the train station to my job (20-25 min), depending on traffic. That\'s roughly 105-115 minutes, but that\'s the way in. The way home is usually closer to three hours from the time I punch out to the time I walk in my door. I have done this commute for over two years. I think the worst part, aside from the fact that my commute costs me $28 a day minimum ($28 round trip train ticket and then either a $10 taxi ride home or a nice one hour walk), is that I am just so tired when I get home I often go to sleep within a couple hours. I should also mention it\'s not exactly a great career and I wake up by 4am everyday to make less than $15 an hour and typing this out made me sad about it... Well thanks for reading my little rant about my commute. I could go into more depth but I think this should cover what could have been a simple "yes" or "no" answer.

This is why the weak are bullied, the mentally ill are shunned, homosexuals are demonised, and nobody likes furries. We live in a modern age but with brains that were 'designed' for very different lifestyles that ceased to exist thousands of years ago when excluding such people made sense.  We now live in an age where 'deviant' behavior by a few does not result in the collapse of society, but we are hard-wired to think it does. Just as we crave sweet and fatty food in an age where such food is both common and cheap. Our brains simply weren't made for the modern world we have to live in."

'in spite of what the Golden Globes will tell you, Get Out is not first and foremost a comedy, and it\'s still a hilarious movie. Blow this off as an "I\'m not racist. I have black friends" thing to say, but I don\'t care. I\'m still going to say it, because I see it as relevant. I\'m a white guy who\'s always been an avid basketball player, and the community which I\'ve been heavily involved with all my life, is disproportionately black, so I would consider myself more accustomed to black people than usual. Yet, the reason why I met one of my 2 best friends, is because I was in college, saw some guy who was a 6\'3 mixed guy, and I just assumed he was a fellow baller. When getting to know him, he isn\'t quite a fellow baller. He\'s read a dozen star wars books, and he says things like "come hither". No one is immune from this sort of stuff, and Get Out reminded me of South Park, where it did a great job of giving you a ridiculous portrayal of yourself, that helps you to grow as well as laugh.'

'TL;DR: while she was taking a shit, I informed my grandma that my grandpa died  I\'ll start. My maternal grandparents divorced long before I was born and my grandma lived with us until she passed on my early 20s. My grandpa died when I was 8. He had been sick a while but his death was sort of sudden.  My mom got the call he was gone early on a Saturday or Sunday before anyone else was awake but me and her. I ran upstairs to tell my grandma, who turned out was in the bathroom presumably taking a morning shit.  I knocked on the door and yelled through the door "hey grandma? Grandpa died!". For the rest of my life, I will never forget the sad "oh..." that came from the other side of that door. But at the time, I just kind of shrugged and went to play SNES.'

'So my mother was a principle in a very small town, my dad worked 3 hours away so he rented an apartment near his office and came home on weekends. One of my moms teachers where retiring because she was having a grand daughter and was going to babysit her while her parents worked, that being said my mom somehow talked her into babysitting me for “a year”. My mom worked about 14 hours a day being an athletic director, late working principle, etc,etc, so I spent a whole lot of time with these people. My mom was always stressed when she came home and a was a very whiny baby/toddler/child so she would stress about that aswell. It got too a point where I think my babysitters nanny senses where coming in and she would randomly drop by our house and just basically take me home with her for a bit then take me back home. Also once that year of her babysitting ended my babysitter just basically told my mom “no, it’s okay” so I spent about the next 4 years with them. So 11-14 hours a day plus a few nights here and there for 5 years straight. I spent more of my childhood with there family then I did my own. When I was 5 we moved away closer to my dads work so we were about 2ish hours away from them and it was extremely tough to leave but luckily I still get to go down and visit with them on spring break, summer, fall break, etc.  Note* never really had grandparents that I could go over to there house a lot and spend time with them due to complications so they basically took me in as there own and it’s an amazing relationship and I think of them as family more then I think my own.'
'This is much harder to make funny writing down than saying out loud but here goes.

"Sure, go ahead" says the man. "Well, could you cook the eggs for so long that they turn to rubber and could bounce off the floor?". "uhh okay no problem we can do that". "And can you toast the bread on the highest temperate so it\'s like eating charcoal?". "Yeah I guess so". "And could you cook the beans for so long that they just turn to mush?". "..okay we can do that". "Oh and finally can you make sure that the sausages are raw in the middle but also burnt on the outside". A few moments go pass and the man looks up and says "look mate we don\'t have enough time to fuss about doing all that stuff". So I said "WELL YOU HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DO IT LAST WEEK!".'

"When I was growing up, I was one of the weird kids, so I had to pick from the weird kids for friends, and that didn't really give me a normal basis for how I should act, and I didn't end up learning how to be normal until I went to college. I rarely talk to my childhood friends anymore, and most of them still live with their parents, even though we're around 28. They still watch anime that isn't age-appropriate, are into My Little Pony, playing kids games, and perpetuating the sheltered lifestyle they grew up with. I can't talk to them about the things I'm interested in at all. My new (from college) friends are well-adjusted, happy, productive members of society. We cook together, we have barbecues, we go to beer festivals, watch thought-provoking movies, talk about philosophical ideas, build things in our wood shops, collect wine, shoot guns, own houses, travel... They're adults. My girlfriend (who's a few years older than my friends) doesn't think of them as adults all the time, but only because none of them have or want kids, and my girlfriend's friends do. Basically, my friends are in a happy zone between the limited interests that kids are supposed to have and the boring monotony of parenthood, where all parents can talk about is their kids."

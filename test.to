'Played the ouija board in my room late one night with my brother. We asked multiple questions and we started getting real answers which started spooking us. We started getting deeper into the questions and we asked what it knew about us and it proceeded to say what I was wearing and my age and the date of my birth. I started getting very light headed and my vision started getting blurry. I decided it was time to put up the board so we did, within the first 5 minutes of ending the session I saw some black figures from in my bedroom running across my hallway into my living room as well as my brother so we just closed the door and ignored it. The only light we had on in my room was this big lamp I have and as we were chillin watching YouTube the lights started flickering constantly and I nearly had a fucking heart attack. I threw about a whole bottle of holy water down all over my room and got the fuck outta there and went on a walk and smoked. Not the most scary thing that has happened just the most recent'

"I used to baby sit the two boys of family while their parents Went out once every few weeks to get some alone time. I had looked after them before and they were usually well behaved and listened very well. This family had a few cats and they would climb in all sorts of odd places such as in the sinks, bookshelves, cupboards etc. Well this night I guess they had left the dryer door open and when one of the kids went downstairs to get his ball hockey gear I guess he closed the door on the cat and started the dryer. I was already outside waiting at this point so I heard nothing about this until we came back inside and I noticed the dryer was on. I asked the kids why it was on and they said their mom was doing laundry. I knew for a fact that it was off when after the parents left so when I went to investigate I opened it to a completely burned and mangled cat that was essentially twisted like a pretzel. I told the parents what happened and that their kid was a psychopath and needs help now because he clearly is not right in the head. Never babysat anyone's kids ever again. The parents were in shock. They didn't blame me or get mad. Just shocked that one of their kids murdered their cat like that. It still makes me uncomfortable to think about him."

'You don\'t need a Harvard professor to answer this. If you have bad habits on how to handle money, how is handing you 100,000 going to fix those bad habits?  It just means you\'ll have the free windfall for a while.  It will be gone soon enough. I worked with helping the homeless in LA in the mid 90\'s, allied with various Hollywood groups, rep Jackie Goldberg, Ted Hayes and HFH, a couple churches.  We provided food and clothing to people.  Year after year, the same people who we gave things to, jobs to, shelter to, the vast majority of them would be in just as bad a shape or dead years later.  Some of them admitted to making as much as 200 a day, working only 4 to 5 hours, tax free, by begging. So realize on a cushy schedule they were making the equivalent, some of them of what it would take a guy making at LEAST 75,000 per year to make.  But they were still "in poverty".  (Keep in mind this is Los Angeles, a beggar can make a lot more here, people here are, on average, far more tolerant and compassionate toward the homeless, which is why the homeless population keeps growing massively every year). A minority of people are in a bad situation due to bad luck and those usually recover very well given a little help.  That\'s what I saw in over 10,000 hours of charity work in the 90\'s. That doesn\'t mean suffering I helped alleviate had no value, that\'s subjective and I am glad I was able to help some even if "it\'s no use, they are just going to make bad choices again" was the regrettable truth.'

'Absolutely nothing. US government debt is very highly sought after, because it\'s considered an extremely safe investment. If China for some reason decided to stop buying it, someone else would pick up what they were no longer buying. China owns about 19% of the US debt held by foreign countries. The debt held by foreign countries is about 31% of the total debt - the rest is held by the US government or by US citizens or entities. So that means China holds nearly 6% of the US national debt. Edited to add: Let\'s be clear about how this debt works. It\'s not that the US government goes to China, hat in hand, saying "Oh, please, sir, will you give us a loan, please?". The treasury says "Okay, we\'re selling X number of bonds at Y interest rate to be paid back in Z time. Take it or leave it." Anyone can then buy those bonds. A lot are bought by the US government itself, particularly the Social Security Administration. A lot are bought by hedge funds, corporations, and individuals, as a safe place to store money. Only a fraction is bought by Chinese interests. Chinese holders buy a lot of US debt for a number of reasons, but one of the big ones is that they sell so much in the US that the end up with lot of US dollars. Rather than move that money back to China and pay various fees and taxes, they chose to keep it in the US and buy treasury bonds with it.'

"I once had a customer demand $1000, literally for no reason. He would not take no for an answer, and spent the entire call advising me that he would have his close personal friend Donald Trump sue me if I did not comply.  When I say that he wouldn't take no for an answer, the conversation went something like this: Me: We will not be granting you this credit. Him: Is that your final answer? Me: Yes, that is our final answer Him: Well I expect you to call me back on Friday with your final answer. Me: ...Sir, this is our final answer, we will not be issuing you a $1000 credit for no reason. Him: Well I expect you to call me back on Friday with your final answer. (this goes back and forth about 3 more times) Me: So you want me to call you again on Friday, just to tell you again that we will not be issuing a $1000 credit? Him: Well, if that's your final answer It was just so infuriating."

'I\'ll just copy what I wrote in another thread: "There was a German version of \'Jack The Ripper\' who was actually called \'Jacob Der Tripper\'. For two reasons, nah three reasons actually: First, it\'s an obvious hommage to Jack The Ripper, secondly \'Tripper\' is a colloquial term in German when referring to gonorrhea and Jacob was known to be plagued by that venereal disease. Back then, it was in the early 1910s, just before WWI broke out, there was no adequate medication for gonorrhea. And if there had been one, it\'s said, Jacob Der Tripper would obviously have avoided seeing a doctor, as he was a serial killer. So anyway, the city of Günzburg is located on the Bavarian side of the border between Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. Since the dawn of time Bavaria has been quite conservative compared to other parts of the German Empire. The thing is, that part of Bayern is actually Swabian, but still officially part of the Bavarian jurisdiction. Of course Germany was the first country to introduce mandatory health insurance under Chancellor Bismarck. So in 1913, a German doctor\'s group, operating in southwest Bavaria came together for one of their regular conferences, a procedure similar to today\'s summits. It was at this conference that it first became apparent that there was a gonorrhea epidemic. The world, even places not far from one another, was obviously not nearly as connected as it is these days. Now we see why I mentioned the health insurance part. Even though there was no effective medicine against Tripper yet, women (and a few men it\'s said) would visit physicians all over the area to at least identify what causes them physical malaise. They were insured after all, so there was no big reason to avoid doctors to seek medical treatment...Well that\'s wrong actually, because in this conservative and rural German area, women with venereal diseases would be judged by doctors. All this is sparsely documented to this day, but it is believed that one day, a 35-year-old woman went to see a close friend of hers, who had studied medicine at the Universität Bayreuth in Franconia, which is the northern part of the state of Bavaria. He examined her and was sure that she was plagued by gonorrhea. The exciting part was that while he still held contact to befriended doctors, he was actually with the Bavarian criminal police at that point. He had switched lanes years before. He was now able to connect the dots of two middle-aged women who had been found dead in a swamp just outside the eastern border of Günzburg. A coroner\'s report had mentioned that both women had suffered from gonorrhea for weeks or even months. The police officer instructed his colleagues to interrogate local doctors concerning patients with gonorrhea. A few doctors confirmed having had patients with a corresponding disease. However all of those patients had sworn the doctors to secrecy, which was undermined by the police force back then. The Bavarian law clearly stated that physicians had to cooperate with the state authorities in a case where urgency preceeded non-disclosure obligations. Three doctors disclosed to the police detectives that they had had female patients with gonorrhea and clear telltale signs of having been raped. When another female corpse had been found in her house in August 1913, the police was approached by an eyewitness. A neighbour from across the street. That person was male and claimed to have witnessed the gruesome murder of his neighbour. He described the suspect who he had seen walking out of the house. The witness said it was around 2:30 a.m. and that he could only see a trenchcoat, a dark hat and dark shoes. Obviously that wasn\'t much for the police to work with. Then, it must have been September 1913, a doctor called the police about a man who came into his office with fever and other typical symptoms of a bacterial infect. The patient insisted on having no idea what\'s up with him and how he might have been infected. The doctor didn\'t believe him, but he showed compassion as he suspected that the patient was either a rape victim or had consensual gay sex and didn\'t dare to admit to that in such a conservative environment. The doctor did however inform the authorities about that patient and described his looks and clothes. Now, a trenchcoat, hat and dark shoes were things worn by lots of gents back then, but the police still got the patient\'s address and visited his house in the city centre of Günzburg. They found him in his bathtub, bled to death. They also found a letter on his dinner table which was a clear admission of guilt regarding multiple murders and rapes in the area of southwestern Bavaria. To this day it is debated why Jacob Der Tripper finally \'gave up\', went to a doctor\'s place and finally killed himself. It\'s even debated whether he actually killed himself or if the true culprit was responsible for his death and putting up wrong traces. I\'m into mysterious criminal cases and this one, while lesser-known, has always intrigued me."'

"I tried going to my normal doctor when I found something growing inside my nose. My doctor was out of the office and had another doctor filling in for him. I told her there was some kind of growth in my nose. She told me it was allergies. I said, no, I know what allergies are like. This is a growth I can actually feel. I had to beg her to take a look. She rolled her eyes and looked with some kind of nose-o-scope and said she didn't see anything and tried to give me a prescription for allergies. I asked her to give me a referral to a specialist and she reluctantly gave me one. So I go to an ENT. I tell him what happened with the doctor and he looks up my nose. He's clearly kind of angry but is trying to be professional and not talk shit, but says that I have a growth in my sinuses that is so large it is visible in both nostrils without instruments. He sends me to get scans and whatnot and it turns out to be a tumor inside my sinuses that is growing out of my skull and is slowly eating away at it. If I don't get it removed it will eat through my skull and kill me. I got it removed and it's a happy ending, but it makes me angry to think of how things might have gone if I'd listened to that doctor."

Dreamt I was on an empty bus and all of a sudden I started hearing some kind of crashing/smashing/chaotic noise (like cymbals and things being dropped, etc.) that increased in volume until I thought my eardrums were going to rupture. Really wanted to cover my ears with my hands but I was unable to move. Had to wait until the auditory hallucination and sleep paralysis passed, which was scary and felt painful. 3.

'On Shattuck Avenue due west and downhill of the university campus is a man who gives himself away. He sits on the sidewalk against a building and offers pieces of himself to passersby. I have seen him give away the second smallest toe on his left foot. I have seen him give away his right earlobe. Both times he took out a knife and sliced them off and there was no blood nor sign of any discomfort on his face and the man and woman to whom he gave those gifts held them with the greatest reverence, as if they were the holy relics of some prophet or saint. Today when I walked by him he told me it was a special day. He had finished off his toes. Ten toes to ten people. May my toes bring them happiness, he said.  The next day I watched as he gave away his left foot to an old lady. He unscrewed it like a child’s toy. He handed it to her and she put it in her oversized purse and did not say a word as she walked off and I imagined her later trying to find its worth online. She’d ask herself if the foot of an old homeless man was an antique. She wouldn’t know but she’d figure it would appreciate in value, so she’d keep it in a locked drawer in her bedroom and she’d call her lawyer and add it to her will, bequeath it to her favorite granddaughter. I asked the man if maybe he shouldn’t be more discerning in whom he gave himself to. But he said I felt like she could use my left foot so I gave it to her. I’ve lived by my feelings and I’ll give myself away just the same. I sat down next to the man and we watched people walk by and one young man stopped and the man asked him to put his hands out and he did and he placed his hands on the younger man’s hands and they were almost the same size. I have a gift for you, said the man. And he took his knife out from his pocket and he skinned his own hands and he gave them to the younger man as gloves. Try them on, said the man.  And the younger man tried them on. They fit perfectly.  Thank you, he said.  May the skin of my hands bring you joy, said the man. I walked by him a few days later and saw he was without legs or arms. He was in a wheelchair and he wore no shirt and I saw he was missing large patches of skin on his face and chest and his nipples were gone. He had no nose and he had yet one eye and I noticed for the first time how bright and blue it was. He asked if I might wheel him to Alta Bates and I did so and it was a long way and when I finally pushed him into the hospital he said Take my eye, so I plucked out his eye and he said Use it well and I said I will and I pushed him up to a desk and the woman behind it said How can I help you?  I’m giving myself away, said the man. Oh, she said, and she picked up the phone and dialed and said, He’s here.  A minute later a woman in light blue scrubs came out and looked at me and saw I was holding his eye and said Thank you for bringing him and then she wheeled him into the interior of the hospital and I never saw him again.'

'Not sure how purely native some of these are, but to preface, I live in the Santa Clarita Valley, which is the far north (not Northeast, not talking about Palmdale) of Los Angeles County.  It\'s a big suburb, fairly boring, a little bit on the conservative side politically compared to the rest of the county. Sclaritan: Santa Clarita Valley resident.  Most cringe at this. The Stanch: Stevenson Ranch, a rich section of our valley, and everyone but people who live there refer to it as that.  People who live there use the full name. DGAF boy: refers to a member of a so-called gang of young (middle class) white kids in our valley, but 99.9% of them would run shrieking like a little girl if anyone ever said "okay let\'s throw down", all they do is petty vandalism and tagging.  The other 0.1% of them are in jail for assault, but probably on their girlfriend.  They are somewhat of an uncomfortable joke in our valley.  First that we have a gang, but secondly that it\'s an utterly pathetic gang.  In all seriousness, most of them probably grow out of it, some few of them focus on attaining a brodozer. Brodozer: giant jacked up pick-up trucks driven by shaved headed white mails with goaties and Oakley wrap-around sunglasses, blasting Arena Rock hits of the 2000\'s or later.  Their trucks are typically used to carry no more than a couple bags of groceries. Awesome Town: the Valencia part of our valley, it is said to make fun of it, not to promote it, because the city actually had the gall, at one point, to have that be their city "motto".'

I almost died twice overseas just because I wanted to go to college and escape abuse.  It\'s a vicious cycle that lots of perfectly good people get swept up into. Some stupid motherfucker posted something on Tumblr saying "don\'t join the military death squads just to go to college!" (that\'s not necessarily a choice when you\'re poor and your life is a dumpster fire, but the privileged piece of shit who wrote that wouldn\'t know).  Then he said "there are other ways to go to college!  Wait until you\'re 24 to go to college so that your parents\' income is no longer counted on your FAFSA!" Excuse me?  So you want people to put their lives on hold for 6 fucking years?

If you try to ask someone for help or directions they probably have already walked past three to four people already who tried to stop them asking for help and were just panhandling.

"Oh, but this is a one time offer at a special introductory rate, you have to sign today!" Nope. Don\'t do it. If they\'re legit, they will let you take the paperwork home, let you study, run it by your lawyer, let you think about it. The ones who insist on you signing it right away know the agreement is a sham and they\'re relying on your greed to get the special deal to sign and NOT notice that clause where you promise to hand over your first born.  Never be pressured into signing anything immediately.  ANd certainly don\'t accept free drinks.  Thats how I wound up with my timeshare - 8 Manhattens later, boy that deal sure was looking good, sure I\'ll sign whatever you want, just bring me another drink.'

So, if you are undiagnosed, then get your diagnosis. Chances are that you are lying to yourself about being on the spectrum and you are just using the condition as an excuse to not do stuff. It is offensive to people who have been diagnosed.

'A few weeks into January I’d decided to unblock my (now) boyfriend. To give a little context— my friend, Bea, didn’t particularly like him. They were friends but some drama happened between him and I which sparked a few months of aggression and depression for the both of us. Bea, being the only friend I’d stayed close to out of it, was of course the one I talked to about all of this. She ultimately pushed me to block him. When I told her I unblocked him she was a little upset with me but simply said, “Just know I think you should’ve kept him blocked.” We haven’t talked since but looking back at it I think she was starting to catch feelings for me, but that’s probably just the narcissism talking.'
"When I was a kid me and my twin brother tried to murder our babysitter. He would not give us any ice cream and we got mad.

Our babysitter freaked out and couldn't believe we tried to kill him. We ended up in court and our mom got a huge fine for giving us access to a gun. Me and twin were probably the first kids to commit attempted murder."

(ie: Job, Partner, Money gaining task)\n2 - Is it fucking you? (ie: Partner, potential partner, etc) Then scale accordingly.  If it scores 2 out of 2... you give fucks.  If it scores 1 of 2, you apply logic to see if you give fucks (can I find new job, can I find new partner).  If it's 0 of 2?  Deuces."

"I'm actually learning a new language at the moment - Japanese! I think the biggest issue I had was how to approach learning it, whether it'd be best to enroll in evening courses, try to learn myself via books or programs, or by getting a private tutor.  Then I had to work out the logistics of fitting this around my work schedule (I work really random shifts, which can start at 8am and finish at 11pm) if I wasn't allowed the time off of work, or if I could find time to fit into my normal day.  As it stands, I sort of lucked out - the only Japanese course near me happens to be at a college 10 minutes form my work, and since it's only once a week, I can take that day as my allocated day off. On the flip side, there will be a five month break between the end of my first year and beginning of my second.  As to whether there's a better method... I'm not too sure. Getting Private tutors can easily be exepensive, and they may not have a complete graps on the language anyway, and learning by myself would cause issues with pronounciations. It would be nicer if my course was more than 1 evening a week, and wouldn't have such a massive break, but I'll take what I can get."

Honestly, driving on the highway is carnage, and you'll end up slamming into so many poor little butterflies that there are times where if you drive long enough you'll have to pull over and clean your windshield just so you can see.  \nI ask what happened an the mom explained that this poor kid was sleeping in the car and had awoke to pure horror. She was so perturbed at the sight of beautiful little bugs being massacred by her mom's car that she begged her mom to pull over. When the mom refused, the girl literally took matters into her own hands and grabbed the steering wheel, driving them into a ditch."
